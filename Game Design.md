# Game Design

Some [principles](https://youtu.be/zaxAdRlyZQ8) to keep in mind:

1. Create concrete, achievable, and rewarding [[goals]].
2. Design for nuanced emotion.
3. Create rapid and robust controls.
4. Make fun toys, and combine them into games.
5. Make the next action obvious.
6. Give clear and immediate [[feedback]] with no distraction.
7. Balance skills with challenge.

## [Fun Theory Insights](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qZJBighPrnv9bSqTZ/31-laws-of-fun)

- **Flow state optimization**: Fun exists in the sweet spot between boredom (too easy) and frustration (too hard). Design for perpetual flow state.
- **Agency without overwhelm**: Provide meaningful choices but not so many that decision paralysis occurs. Options should feel empowering, not burdensome.
- **Joy in discovery**: Don't give people answers they haven't figured out themselves. The process of discovery is often more rewarding than the solution.
- **Challenge authenticity**: Bypasses and cheats make challenges feel less real, even if unused. Maintain the integrity of difficulty.
- **Environmental over mental changes**: When designing systems, prefer changing the environment to changing how people think. Less invasive, more ethical.
- **Interpersonal complexity**: People making things difficult for each other prevents boredom. Social dynamics create endless variety.
- **Sensual bandwidth**: High-bandwidth sensory experiences (tactile, visual, auditory) are essential for engagement and meaning.
