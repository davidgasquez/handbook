# Cooperatives

- A cooperative is an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned and democratically-controlled enterprise
  - Labor, capital, and governance are shared.
- There are [many ways to form cooperatives](https://institute.coop/sites/default/files/resources/356%202009_Johnson%20etal_Tech%20Freelancers%20Guide%20to%20Worker%20Co-ops.pdf).
- Useful when the work is not capital-intensive. E.g: [you can start curating and selling datasets, or providing consulting services with little capital (a computer and an internet connection)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjsGp5KPxx8).
