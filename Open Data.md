# Open Data

> Bring Open Data to the level of Open Source.
> Make Open Data compatible with the modern data ecosystem (tooling, approaches, ...).

## Motivation

[Open Data is a public good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data#Open_Data_as_commons). As a result, individual [[incentives]] are not aligned with collective ones.

As an organization or research group, [spending time curating and maintaining datasets for other people to use doesn't make economic sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics_of_open_data), unless you can profit from that.

The current landscape has a few problems:

- **Non Interoperability**. Data is isolated in multiples places and between different formats.
- **Data Loss**. Data is commonly stored in perishable hardware and formats.
- **Hard to Search**. Datasets indexing is difficult since [there are many standards](https://xkcd.com/927/).
- **No Collaboration**. No incentives exists for people to work on improving or curating datasets.

[Open Data can help organizations, scientist, and governments make better decisions](https://twitter.com/patrickc/status/1256987283141492736). Data is one of the best ways to learn about the world and [[Coordination|coordinate]] people.

Open protocols create open systems. Open code creates tools. **Open data creates open knowledge**. We need better tools, protocols, and mechanisms to improve the Open Data ecosystem. It should be easyÂ to find, download, process, publish, and collaborate on open datasets.

Iterative improvements over public datasets would yield large amounts of value ([Dune did it with blockchain data](https://dune.com/blog/the-community-data-platform)). Access to data gives people the opportunity to create new business and make better decisions. Open Source code has made a huge impact in the world. Let's make Open Data do the same!

### Why Now?

We have cheaper storage, better compute, and more data. We need to improve our workflows now. How does a world where people collaborate on datasets looks like?

During the last few years, a Cambrian explosion of open source tools have emerged. There are new query engines (e.g: DuckDB, DataFusion, ...), execution frameworks (WASM), data standards (Arrow, Parquet, ...), and a growing set of open data marketplaces (Datahub, HuggingFace Datasets, Kaggle Datasets).

These trends have already quick-started movements like [DeSci](https://ethereum.org/en/desci/) but we still need more tooling around data to make interoperability possible. **We should use the same modern tooling companies are using to manage open datasets**. A sort of [Data Operating system](https://data-operating-system.com/). Having better data will create better and more accessible AI models ([people are working on this](https://github.com/togethercomputer/OpenDataHub)).

Data wrangling is a perpetual maintenance commitment, taking a lot of ongoing attention and resources. [Better and modern data tooling can reduce these costs](https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudl).

Organizations like [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/) or [538](https://fivethirtyeight.com/) provide useful analysis but have to deal with _dataset management_. They end up building custom tools around their workflows. That works, but limits the potential of these datasets. In the end, there is no `data get OWID/daily-covid-cases`, no `data query "select * from 538/polls"` that could act as entry-point to explore datasets.

We could have a better ecosystem if we **collaborate on open standards**! So, lets move towards more composable, maintainable, and reproducible open data.

## Design Principles

- **Easy**. Create, curate and share datasets without friction.
  - Data is useful only when used! Right now, we're not using most of humanity's datasets. That's not because they're not available but because they're hard to get. They're isolated in different places and formats.
  - Pragmatism: published data is better than almost published one because something is missing.
- **Versioned and Modular**. Data and metadata (e.g: `relation`) should be [updated, forked and discussed](https://github.com/jbenet/data/blob/master/dev/designdoc.md#data-hashes-and-refs) as code in version controlled repositories.
  - Prime composability (e.g: [Arrow ecosystem](https://thenewstack.io/how-apache-arrow-is-changing-the-big-data-ecosystem/)) so tools/services can be swapped.
  - Metadata as a first-class citizen.
  - Git based approach collaboration. Adopt and integrate with `git`  to reduce surface area. Build tooling to adapt revisions, tags, branches, issues, PRs to datasets.
  - Provide a declarative way of defining the datasets schema and other meta-properties like _relations_ or _tests_.
  - Support for integrating non-dataset files. A dataset could be linked to code, visualizations, pipelines, models, ...
- **Reproducible and Verifiable**. People should be able to trust the final datasets without having to recompute everything from scratch. In real life events are immutable, data should be too. Make datasets the center of the tooling like [software defined assets](https://dagster.io/blog/software-defined-assets).
  - Thanks to immutability and content addressing, you can move backwards in time and run transformations or queries on how the dataset was at a certain point in time.
- **Permissionless**. Anyone should be able to add/update/fix datasets or their metadata. GitHub style collaboration, curation, and composability.
- **Aligned Incentives**. Curators should have incentives to improve datasets. Data is messy after all, but a good set of incentives could make great datasets surface and reward contributors accordingly.
  - [Bounties](https://www.dolthub.com/bounties) could be created to reward people that adds useful but missing datasets.
  - Surfacing and creating great datasets should be rewarded.
  - Curating the data provides compounding benefits for the entire community!
  - Rewarding the datasets creators according to the usefulness. E.g: [CommonCrawl built an amazing repository](https://commoncrawl.org/) that OpenAI has used for their GPTs LLMs. Not sure how well CommonCrawl was compensated.
- **Open Source and Decentralized**. Datasets should be stored in multiple places.
  - Don't create yet another standard. Provide a way for people to integrate current indexers. Work on _adapters_ for different datasets sources. Similar to:
    - [Foreign Data Wrappers in PostgreSQL](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Foreign_data_wrappers)
    - [Trustfall](https://github.com/obi1kenobi/trustfall).
    - Open source data integration projects like [Airbyte](https://airbyte.com/). They can used to build open data connectors making possible to replicate something from `$RANDOM_SOURCE` (e.g: spreadsheets, Ethereum Blocks, URL, ...) to any destination.
    - Adapters are created by the community so data becomes connected.
  - Integrate with the modern data stack to avoid reinventing the wheel.
  - Decentralized the computation (where data lives) and then cache copies of the results (or aggregations) in CDNs. Most queries require only reading a small amount of data and going to be similar.

## Modules

### Packaging

Package managers have been hailed among the most important innovations Linux brought to the computing industry. The activities of both publishers and users of datasets resemble those of authors and users of software packages.

- **Distribution**. Decentralized. No central authority. Can work in a closed network. Cache/CDN friendly.
  - A data package is an URI ([like in Deno](https://deno.land/manual@v1.31.2/examples/manage_dependencies)). You can import from an URL (`data add example.com/dataset.yml` or `data add example.com/hub_curated_datasets.yml`).
  - As [Rufus Pollock puts it](https://datahub.io/docs/dms/notebook#go-modules-and-dependency-management-re-data-package-management-2020-05-16-rufuspollock), Keep it as simple as possible. Store the table location and schema and get me the data on the hard disk fast.
- **Indexing**. Should be easy to list datasets matching a certain pattern or reading from a certain source.
  - Datasets could be linked to a [[Open Data#Datafile |Datafile]]/`datapackage.yml` with description, default visualizations, WASM linked code...
  - One repository, one dataset or catalog/hub.
  - To avoid yet another open dataset portal, build adapters to integrate with other indexes.
    - For example, bring all HF datasets by making a simple PR on their repository that generates a `datapackage.yml` reusing their parquet files.
- **Formatting**. Datasets should be saved and exposed in multiple formats (CSV, Parquet, ...). Could be done via WASM transformations or in the fly when pulling data. The package manager should be **format and storage agnostic**.
- **Social**. Allow users, organizations, stars, citations, attaching default visualizations (d3, [Vega](https://vega.github.io/), [Vegafusion](https://github.com/vegafusion/vegafusion/), and others), ...
  - Importing datasets. Making possible to `data fork user/data`, improve something and publish the resulting dataset back (via something like a PR).
  - Have issues and discussions close to the dataset.
- **Extensible**. Users could extend the package resource (e.g: [Time Series Tabular Package inherits from Tabular Package](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/tabular-data-package/)) and add better support for more specific kinds of data (geographical).
  - Integrations could be built to ingest/publish data from other hubs (e.g: CKAN)

### Storage

- **Permanence**. Each [version](https://tech.datopian.com/versioning/) should be permanent and accessible.
- **Versioning**. Should be able to manage _diffs_ and _incremental changes_ in a smart way. E.g: only storing the new added rows or updated columns.
  - Should allow [automated harvesting of new data](https://tech.datopian.com/harvesting/) with sensors (external functions) or scheduled jobs.
  - Each version is referenced by a hash. Git style.
- **Smart**. Use appropriate protocols for storing the data. E.g: rows/columns shouldn't be duplicated if they don't change.
  - Think at the dataset level and not the file level.
  - Tabular data could be partitioned to make it easier for future retrieval.
- **Immutability**. Never remove historical data. Data should be append only.
  - Similar to how `git` deals with it. You could force the deletion of something in case that's needed, but not the default.
- **Flexible**. Allow centralized ([S3](https://twitter.com/quiltdata/status/1569447878212591618), GCS, ...) and decentralized (IPFS, Hypercore, Torrent, ...) layers.
  - As agnostic as possible, supporting many types of data; tables, geospatial, images, ...
  - Can all datasets can be represented as tabular datasets? This will enable to run SQL (`select, groupbys, joins`) on top of them which might be the easier way to start collaborating.
  - A dataset could have different formats derived from a common one.  Represent all data as Arrow datasets, and build converters between that one format and all others. This is how Pandoc and LLVM work. The protocol could do the transformation (e.g: CSV to Parquet, JSON to Arrow, ...) automatically and some checks at the data level to verify they contain the same information.
  - Datasets could be tagged from a library of types (e.g: `ip-adress`) and [conversion functions](https://github.com/jbenet/transformer) (`ip-to-country`). Given that the representation is common (Arrow), the transformations could be written in multiple languages.

### Transformations

- **Deterministic**. Packaged lambda style transformations (WASM/Docker).
  - For tabular data, starting with just SQL might be great.
  - Pyodite + DuckDB for transformations could cover a large area.
  - Datasets could be derived by importing other datasets and applying deterministic transformations in the `Datafile`. Similar to Docker containers. That file will carry [Metadata, Lineage and even some defaults (visualizations, code, ...)](https://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/basics/101-127-yoda.html)
- **Declarative**. Everything should be defined as code. E.g: YAML files with the source datasets and the transformations. Similar to how Pachyderm/Kamu/Holium do.
  - E.g: The tool ends up orchestrating containers that read/write from the storage layer, Pachyderm style.
- **Environment agnostic**. Can be run locally and remotely. One machine or a cluster. Streaming or batch.
- **Templated**. Having a repository/market of open transformations could empower a bunch of use cases ready to plug in to datasets:
  - Detect outliers automatically on tabular data.
  - Resize images.
  - Normalize sound files.
  - Detect suspicions records like a categorical variable value that only appears one time while others values appear many times.
  - Enrich data smartly (Match and Augment pattern). If a matcher detects a date, the augmenter can add the day of week. If is something like a latitude and longitude, the augmenter adds country/city. [Some tools do this with closed source data](https://www.getcensus.com/blog/census-enrichment-third-party-data-enrichment-now-in-your-warehouse).
  - [Templated validations to make sure datasets conform to certain standards](https://framework.frictionlessdata.io/docs/checks/baseline.html).

### Visualizations

- **Sane Defaults**. Suggest basic charts (bars, lines, time series, clustering). Multiple [views](https://tech.datopian.com/views/).
- **Exploratory**. Allow drill downs and customization. Offer a [simple way](https://lite.datasette.io/) for people to query/explore the data.
- **Dynamic**. Use only the data you need. No need to pull 150GB.

## Extra Thoughts

- [Making a SQL interface](https://twitter.com/josephjacks_/status/1492931290416365568) to query and mix these datasets could be a great step forward since it'll enable tooling like `dbt` to be used on top of it. **Data-as-code**.
  - SQL should be enough for unlocking most part of the potential. E.g: joining Wikipedia data to Our World In Data.
  - There are some [web3 DAOs already using `dbt` to improve data models](https://github.com/MetricsDAO/harmony_dbt/tree/main/models/metrics)!

## Open Questions

- What would be a great use case to start with?
  - Why should people use this vs doing their own thing?
- How can datasets be indexed?
- What is the incentive for people to adopt it?
  - [If everybody could converge to it, e.g:Â _"datapackage.json_"Â as a metadata and schema description standard, then, an ecosystem of utilities and libraries for processing data would take advantage of it](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15346836).
- How can LLMs help "building bridges"?
  - E.g: point a GPT wrapper to a GitHub repository and get the auto-generated `datapakage.json`. It should infer files, schema, and types and generate some metadata for us. Then, a "dataset package" can be anything the tool can crawl.
  - [[Language Models Applications |LLMs can parse unstructured data (CSV) and also generate structure from any data source (scrapping websites)]]
- How can we stream new data reliably? E.g: some datasets like Ethereum `blocks` are not static.
- Is it possible to [mount large amount of data](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/) ([FUSE](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-fuse)) from a remote source and get it dynamically as needed?
- Can new table formats play efficiently with IPFS?
  - E.g: Running [`delta-rs`](https://github.com/delta-io/delta-rs) on top of IPFS.
  - Parquet could be a great fit if we figure out how to deterministically serialize it and integrate with IPLD.
- How to work with private data?
  - Homomorphic encription?
- How could something like [Ver](https://raulcastrofernandez.com/data-discovery-updates/) works? If you can envision the table you would like to have in front of you, i.e., you can write down the attributes you would like the table to contain, then the system will find it for you.

## Open Source Web Data IDE

After playing with [Rill Developer](https://github.com/rilldata/rill-developer), DuckDB, Vega, WASM, [Rath](https://rath.kanaries.net/), and other modern Data IDEs, I think we have all the pieces for an awesome web based BI/Data exploration tool. Some of the features it could have:

- Let me add local and remote datasets. Not just one as I'd like to join them later.
- Let me plot it using Vega-Lite. Guide me through alternatives like [Vega's Voyager2](https://vega.github.io/voyager2/) does.
- Use LLMs to improve the datasets and offer next steps:
  - Get suggested transformations for certain columns. If it detect a date, extract day of the week. If it detects a string, `lower()` it...
  - Get suggested plots. Given that it'll know both the column names and the types. Should be possible to create a prompt that returns some plot ideas and another that takes that and write the Vega-Lite code to make it work.
  - Make it easy to query the data via Natural Language.
- Let me transform them with SQL ([DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/)) and Python ([JupyterLite](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)). Similar to [Neptyne](https://neptyne.com/) but in the browser (WASM).
- Let me save the plots in a separate space and give me a shareable URL encoded link.
  - Local datasets could be shared using something like [Magic Wormhole](https://github.com/magic-wormhole/magic-wormhole) or a temporal storage service.
- Let me grab the state of the app (YAML/JSON, version control it, and generate static (to publish in GitHub Pages) and dynamic (hosted somewhere) dashboards from it.
  - Similar to [evidence.dev](https://evidence.dev/) or [portal.js](https://portaljs.org/).
- It could also have "smart" data checks. Similar to [deepchecks](https://github.com/deepchecks/deepchecks) alerting for anomalies, outliers, noisy variables, ...
- Given a large amount of [[Open Data]]. It could offer a way for people to upload their datasets [and get them augmented](https://subsets.io/).
  - E.g: Upload a CSV with year and country and the tool could suggest GDP per Capita or population.

Could be an awesome front-end to explore [[Open Data]].
