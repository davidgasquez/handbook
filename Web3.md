## Web3
- Web3 is much more than [[Blockchain]] and [[Cryptocurrencies]]. [It means building in public, new types of incentives, real ownership of digital property, internet-wide login / identity](https://ckarchive.com/b/p9ueh9hp409k), ...
- Key decisions associated with maintaining and updating cryptonetwork protocols. As with every human organization, aligning interests and beliefs among human participants to reach agreement is the goal of [[governance]].
  - [In cryptonetworks, these decisions are made by the community, using open and transparent mechanisms](https://onezero.medium.com/why-decentralization-matters-5e3f79f7638e). DAOs don't need a boss!
  - Cryptocurrencies have the [[Incentives]] to keep the users happy since forking is an option.
- [Web3 is a decentralized internet. Under Web3, the internet is shared online and governed by the collective "we"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SWJw_NTyUvgdB_asRzsnVyKjciW8dZbeqQeUeWsEiQc).
- Web3 incentives open source. That creates an ecosystem of composable and permissionless tools that increases the speed of innovation.
- This new space encourages experimentation in a diverse set of fields like [[Governance]] or [[Finances]].
