# Impact Evaluators

Impact Evaluators are frameworks for [[Coordination|coordinating]] work and aligning [[Incentives]] in complex [[Systems]]. They provide mechanisms for retrospectively evaluating and rewarding contributions based on impact, helping solve coordination problems in [[Public Goods Funding]].

It's hard to do [[Public Goods Funding]], open-source software, research, etc. that don't have a clear, immediate financial return, especially high-risk/high-reward projects. Traditional funding often fails here. Instead of just giving money upfront (prospectively), Impact Evaluators create systems that look back at what work was actually done and what impact it actually had (retrospectively). It's much easier to judge the impact in a retrospective way!

- The goal is to **create a system with strong [[Incentives]] for people/teams to work on valuable, uncertain things** by distributing a reward according to the demonstrable impact.
- Impact Evaluators work well on concrete areas where you can turn into easily measurable metrics. Impact Evaluators are powerful and will overfit. When the goal is not well aligned, they can be harmful. E.g: Bitcoin increasing the energy consumption of the planet. **Impact Evaluators can become Externalities Maximizers**.
- **Start local and iterate**.
  - Begin with small communities with their own [[Metrics]] and evaluation criteria.
  - Use rapid [[Feedback Loops]] to learn what works.
  - Each community understands its context better than outsiders ([seeing like a state blinds you to local realities](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/16/book-review-seeing-like-a-state/)).
  - Multiple local experiments surface patterns for higher-level abstractions.
  - Impact evaluation should be done by the community at the local level.
    - E.g: "Developers" in OSO filter for GitHub accounts with more than 5 commits. Communities might or might not align with that metric.
  - Focus on positive sum games and mechanisms.
  - Small groups enable iterated games that reward trust and penalize defection. Reduced size reduce friction.
  - Have a deadline or something like that so it fades away if it's not working or actively used.
  - [The McNamara Fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McNamara_fallacy). Never choose metrics on the basis of what is easily measurable over what is meaningful. Data is inherently objectifying and naturally reduces complex conceptions and process into coarse representations. There's a certain fetish for data that can be quantified.
  - Cultivate a culture which welcomes experimentation.
  - Ostrom's Law. "A resource arrangement that works in practice can work in theory"
- **Community Feedback Mechanism**.
  - Implement robust feedback systems that allow participants to report and address concerns about the integrity of the metrics or behaviors in the community.
  - Use the feedback to refine and improve the system.
  - Prioritize consent and community feedback.
  - Community should steer the ship.
  - You want a reactive and self balancing system. Loops where one parts reacts the other parts.
    - Feedback loop with the errors of the previous round.
  - Design a democratic control that reacts to feedback.
  - Allow people to express themselves as much as they want.
    - E.g: an expert can give very precise feedback/knowledge/weights to a set of projects, while a community member can give a more general feedback.
  - Which algorithm is the best assigning weights is not the best question.
    - What would you change about the algorithm?
    - What would you change about the process?
- **Communities usually lack important information to fund public goods**
  - [Every community and institutions wants to see a better, more responsive and dynamic provision of public goods within them, usually lack information about which goods have the greatest value and know quite a bit about social structure internally which would allow them to police the way GitCoin has in the domains it knows](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/a-vision-for-a-pluralistic-civilizational-scale-infrastructure-for-funding-public-goods/9503/11).
  - Impact Evaluators act as a framework for information gathering and can help communities make better decisions.
  - [[Open Data]] Platforms for the community to gather better data and make better decisions.
- **Simplicity as a principle**.
  - [The simpler a mechanism, the less space for hidden privilege](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2020/09/11/coordination.html).
  - Fewer parameters mean more resistance to corruption and overfit and more people engaging.
  - Fix rules to keep things simple and easy to play. Opinionated framework with sane defaults!
  - Demonstrably fair and impartial to all participants (open source and publicly verifiable execution), with no hidden biases or privileged interests
  - Don't write specific people or outcomes into the mechanism (e.g: using multiple accounts)
- **Build anti-Goodhart resilience**.
  - Any metric used for decisions [becomes subject to gaming pressures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell%27s_law).
  - Design for evolution:
    - Run multiple evaluation algorithms in parallel and let humans choose.
    - Use exploration/exploitation trade-offs (like multi-armed bandits) to test new metrics.
    - Make the meta-layer for evaluating evaluators explicit.
  - For areas/ecosystems with a continuous and evaluable output (e.g: "better path finding algorithm", "ROC AUC of X", ...), follow Bittensor model.
  - The easier to verify the solution is (e.g: verify a program passes the test vs verify the experiment replicates), the less human judgment is needed, the less Goodhart's Law applies.
  - If the domain of the IE is sortable and differentiable, it can be seen as pure optimization and doesn't require humans subjective evaluation.
- **Collusion resistance**.
  - Any mechanism helping under-coordinated parties will also help [over-coordinated parties extract value](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2019/04/03/collusion.html). Countermeasures include:
    - Identity-free incentives (like proof-of-work).
    - Fork-and-exit rights for minorities.
    - Privacy pools that exclude provably malicious actors.
    - Multiple independent "dashboard organizations" preventing capture.
  - They should be flexible as it's hard to predict ways the evaluation metrics will be gamed.
  - [Campbell's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell%27s_law). The more any quantitative social indicator is used for social decision-making, the more subject it will be to corruption pressures and the more apt it will be to distort and corrupt the social processes it is intended to monitor.
- **Separate data from judgment**. [Impact Evaluators work like data-driven organizations](https://handbook.davidgasquez.com/data/data-culture):
  - Gather objective attestations about work (commits, usage stats, dependencies).
  - Apply multiple "evaluation lenses" to interpret the data.
  - Let funders choose which lenses align with their values.
  - When collecting data, [pairwise comparisons and rankings are more reliable than absolute scoring](https://anishathalye.com/designing-a-better-judging-system/).
    - Humans excel at relative judgments, but struggle with absolute judgments.
    - Many algorithms can be used to convert pairwise comparisons into absolute scores.
    - Pairwise shines when all the context is in the UX.
- **Design for composability**. Define clear data structures (graphs, weight vectors) as APIs between layers.
  - Multiple communities could share measurement infrastructure.
  - Different evaluation methods can operate on the same data.
  - Evolution through recombination rather than redesign.
  - To create a permissionless way for projects to participate, staking is a solution.
  - Fix a Data Structure (API) for each layer so they can compose (graph, weight vector).
    - E.g: Deepfunding problem data structure is a graph. Weights are a vector/dict, ...
- **Embrace plurality over perfection**.
  - [No single mechanism can satisfy all desirable properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem) (efficiency, fairness, incentive compatibility, budget balance). Different contexts need different trade-offs.
  - There will be no "stable state". Whenever you fix an evaluation, some group has an incentive to abuse or break it again and feast on the wreckage.
  - This is the formal impossibility theorem that no mechanism can simultaneously achieve four desirable criteria:
    - Pareto Efficiency: The outcome achieved by the mechanism maximizes the overall welfare or some other desirable objective function.
    - Incentive Compatibility: Designing mechanisms so that participants are motivated to act truthfully, without gaining by misrepresenting their preferences.
    - Individual Rationality: Ensuring that every participant has a non-negative utility (or at least no worse off) by participating in the mechanism.
    - Budget Balance: The mechanism generates sufficient revenue to cover its costs or payouts, without running a net deficit.
- **Legible Impact Attribution**. Make contributions and their value visible.
  - [Transform vague notions of "alignment" into measurable criteria](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/09/28/alignment.html) that projects can compete on.
  - Designing Impact Evaluators has the side effect of making impact more legible, decomposed into specific properties, which can be represented by specific metrics.
  - Do more to make different aspects of alignment legible, while not centralizing in one single "watcher" (e.g: l2beats, ...).
  - Let projects compete on measurable criteria rather than connections.
  - Create separation of evaluations through multiple independent "dashboard organizations".
- **Incomplete contracts problem**. [It's expensive to measure what really matters](https://meaningalignment.substack.com/p/market-intermediaries-a-post-agi), so we optimize proxies that drift from true goals.
  - Current markets optimize clicks and engagement over human flourishing.
  - The more powerful the optimization, the more dangerous the misalignment.
  - Four interconnected issues:
    - Incomplete contracts - It's too expensive to measure what really matters (human flourishing), so we contract on proxies (hours worked, subscriptions).
    - Power asymmetries - Large suppliers face millions of individual consumers with take-it-or-leave-it contracts.
    - Externalities - Individual flourishing depends on community wellbeing, but contracts remain individualized.
    - Information asymmetries - Suppliers control the metrics and optimize for growth rather than user outcomes.
- **Information elicitation without verification**.
  - Getting truthful data from subjective evaluation when you can't verify it requires clever [[Mechanism Design]]:
    - [Peer prediction mechanisms](https://jonathanwarden.com/information-elicitation-mechanisms/) that reward agreement with hidden samples
    - [Bayesian Truth Serum](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1102081) that uses both answers and predictions.
    - Coordination games where truth serves as a Schelling point.
  - Tradeoffs when jurors vote on public goods funding allocation:
    - Voting directly on projects: halo effect, peanut butter distributions, heavy operational workload
    - Voting on models: feels too abstract for voters and doesn't leverage their specific project expertise
    - Voting on metrics: judges just play with numbers until they get their favored allocation
- [An allocation mechanism can be seen as a measurement process, with the goal being the reduction of uncertainty concerning present beliefs about the future. An effective process will gather and leverage as much information as possible while maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio of that information — aims which are often at odds](https://blog.zaratan.world/p/quadratic-v-pairwise).
- In the digital world, we can apply several techniques to the same input and evaluate the potential impacts. E.g: Simulate different voting systems and see which one fits the best with the current views. This is a case for the system to **have a meta-evaluation mechanism that acts as a layer for human to express preferences**.
- **Make evaluation infrastructure permissionless**. Just as anyone can fork code, anyone should be able to fork evaluation criteria. This prevents capture and enables innovation.
  - Anyone should be able to [fork the evaluation system with their own criteria](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/09/28/alignment.html), preventing capture and enabling experimentation.
- [IEs are the scientific method in disguise, like AI evals](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/eval-process/).
- **Focus on error analysis**. Like in [LLM evaluations](https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/evals-faq/), understanding failure modes matters more than optimizing metrics. Study what breaks and why.
  - IEs will have to do some sort of "error analysis". [Is the most important activity in LLM evals](https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/evals-faq/#q-why-is-error-analysis-so-important-in-llm-evals-and-how-is-it-performed). Error analysis helps you decide what evals to write in the first place. It allows you to identify failure modes unique to your application and data.
- **Reduce cognitive load for humans**. Let [algorithms handle scale while humans set direction and audit results](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2025/02/28/aihumans.html).
  - Use humans for sensing qualitative properties, machines for bookkeeping and preserve legitimacy by letting people choose/vote on the prefered evaluation mechanism.
- Making it so people don't have to do something is cool. Making it so people can't do that thing is bad. E.g: time saving tools like AI is great but humans should be able to jump in if they want!
  - If people don't want to have their "time saved" have the freedom to express themselves. E.g: offer pairwise comparisons by default but let people expand on feedback or send large project reviews.
  - Information gathering is messy and noisy. It's hard to get a clear picture of what people think. Let people express themselves as much as they want.
- The more humans get involved, the messier (papers, ... academia). You cannot get away from humans in most problems.
- **Verify the evaluation is actually better than the baseline**.
  - Run multiple "aggregations" algorithms and have humans blindly select which one they prefer (blind test).
  - The meta-layer can help compose and evaluate mechanisms. How do we know mechanism B is better than A? Or even better than A + B, how do we evolve things?
  - Is the evaluation/reward better than a centralized/simpler alternative?
    - E.g: on tabular clinical prediction datasets, standard logistic regression was found to be on par with deep recurrent models.
- **Exploration vs Exploitation**. IEs are optimization processes with tend to exploit (more impact, more reward). This ends up with a monopoly (100% exploit). You probably want to always have some exploration.
- [IEs need to show how the solution is produced by the interactions of people each of whom possesses only partial knowledge](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44232461).
