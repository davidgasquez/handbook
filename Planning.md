# Planning

![[Quotes#^07c32d]]

Whether it comes naturally or is the result of a concerted effort and process, every [[Systems|system]] plans to achieve the same benefits:

- [[Focus]] on the right priorities.
- Clear Ownership.
- [[Coordination]].
- High shipping velocity.

The goal of planning is to get to a unified and realistic plan for what the system is collectively working towards over a given time horizon.

To help with planning, you should have these things:

- Longterm Vision Statement. Where are you going.
- [[Writing a Roadmap |Roadmap]]. A unified view of what the team is working towards shipping.
- List of options.

No matter what the final plan is, [[Teamwork#^473cb4|document it]] and you'll have a log of all the plans to reflect back on.
