Badgeholders would do a light review to filter out spam, but left everything else intact. Projects had to get at least 17 votes in order to receive rewards. Over 600 projects ended up getting approved. Badgeholders still had to determine outright token allocations for each of the 600+ projects. Badgeholders could also create “lists” recommending projects and outright allocations.\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003eVoters felt overwhelmed. It was very difficult to differentiate between weak projects and good ones with little reputation; borderline projects led campaigns to reach the quorum line. The domain categories were not strictly enforced and thus mostly useless to badgeholders. Impact metrics were not comparable. Every list was different and there was no quality control.

Results had a steep power law distribution, but voters generally felt the top projects were rewarded fairly. Metrics alone couldn’t capture quality, momentum, and other nuances, highlighting the need for more complex evaluation signals. Metrics did not work as well for certain “cutting-edge” sub-domains (eg, 4337 related apps).

This follows basic product theory: you need to show people something and iterate based on their reactions in order to build something they actually want.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003ca name=\"p-41452-metrics-driven-experts-in-the-loop-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-41452-metrics-driven-experts-in-the-loop-3\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003eMetrics-driven, experts in the loop\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese hard-earned lessons inform our recommendation for how Optimism approaches future round designs. The goal should be to combine the best parts of what humans and data are good at.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere is the basic framework we propose:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWe use metrics-based evaluations to propose initial token allocations within a domain.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWe let subject matter experts review, fine-tune the metrics, and choose the best allocations.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOver time, we identify which metrics best align with experts’ qualitative assessments, refining models through consistent backtesting.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis approach leverages data’s systematic reach with human intuition’s nuanced adjustments. Metrics establish a quantitative foundation, ensuring that projects are assessed objectively and fairly, while expert review adds layers of qualitative nuance, including quality, innovation, and momentum. An iterative feedback loop lets us adjust metrics based on expert insights—particularly valuable when experts consistently revise scores or highlight lower-scoring projects. This process is similar to RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback) in machine learning, but with an emphasis on retaining clear, interpretable inputs for expert adjustments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePractically, we implement this by establishing metrics within a domain, generating proposals for initial allocations (by weighting metrics into an evaluation algorithm), and refining the allocations with expert input. Such an approach should work best in domains with lots of verifiable data, e.g., onchain builders and software dependencies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis framework should also perform well in fast-evolving domains. Experts can adjust allocations to reflect Optimism’s shifting priorities (e.g., prioritizing interoperability transactions over standard transactions), address data blind spots (e.g., fine-tuning metrics for 4337-related projects), and reward innovation (e.g., favoring fast-growing, high-potential projects over more established but static ones).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne essential element is running funding rounds even more frequently and continuously. Doing so lets us pinpoint metrics most correlated with desirable outcomes and backtest these metrics and evaluation algorithms against historical data. Each round remains an experiment, but the cumulative impact across rounds should reveal a clear, positive trend over time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003ca name=\"p-41452-hard-choices-easy-life-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-41452-hard-choices-easy-life-4\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003eHard Choices → Easy Life\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe end goal remains super ambitious: to develop predictive models that guide economic policy for the collective. For instance, in 2025, we may want to discover that incentivizing certain behaviors predictably leads to increased interoper transaction volume.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching this goal won’t be easy. It requires focus, as the outcomes are highly path-dependent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurrently, hard choices need to be made around domain scopes. Any changes may be unpopular, especially among community members accustomed to existing Retro Funding patterns. However, narrowing the scope and committing to continuous improvement within scopes are essential steps in reaching the top of the mountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"\u003e\u003ca class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/e/e8c2684c34954a269f489a8549d29f4e6abe8a64.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/xd5hVjQX46YkPSmZgXfvABC8Nrm.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/e/e8c2684c34954a269f489a8549d29f4e6abe8a64_2_605x499.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"xd5hVjQX46YkPSmZgXfvABC8Nrm\" width=\"605\" height=\"499\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/e/e8c2684c34954a269f489a8549d29f4e6abe8a64_2_605x499.png, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/e/e8c2684c34954a269f489a8549d29f4e6abe8a64.png 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/e/e8c2684c34954a269f489a8549d29f4e6abe8a64.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"040404\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"meta\"\u003e\u003csvg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"\u003e\u003cuse href=\"#far-image\"\u003e\u003c/use\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003cspan class=\"filename\"\u003eimage\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"informations\"\u003e800×661 27 KB\u003c/span\u003e\u003csvg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"\u003e\u003cuse href=\"#discourse-expand\"\u003e\u003c/use\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking back, we’ll likely see some initial assumptions were overly optimistic or naive.

So they give 1-2% to lots of small projects. Even if there are some zero votes, the median is still likely to be around 1-2%.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, many badgeholders have historically been wary of giving very large allocations to projects they feel are high impact, eg, over 10%. So large projects will also get a lot of 1-2% votes and then a few \u0026gt;10%, but not enough to significantly skew the median.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe result is a median of 1-2% for a small project and maybe 3-5% for a large project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf a well-known large project wanted to take advantage of this tendency and optimize its retro funding, it would almost certainly do better by submitting 5 projects with a combined expected value of 5-10% (versus the current 3-5% for a single project).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: I’m writing this from recall -
