# Stoicism

- We don't control and cannot rely on external events, but we can (to a certain extent) control our mind and choose our behavior.
- [Stoicism is a tool set that helps us direct our thoughts and actions in an unpredictable world](https://www.njlifehacks.com/what-is-stoicism-overview-definition-10-stoic-principles/).
- It's not what happens to us but our reactions to it that matter.
- Stoicism is known as a eudaimonistic theory, which means that the culmination of human endeavor or "end" (telos) is *eudaimonia*, meaning very roughly "happiness" or "flourishing". The Stoics defined this end as "living in agreement with nature". "Nature" is a complex and multivalent concept for the Stoics, and so their definition of the goal or final end of human striving is very rich.
- Stoicism teaches how to keep a calm and [[Thinking |rational]] mind no matter what happens to you and it helps you understand and focus on what you can control and not worry about and accept what you can't control.
	- There are two circles; the circle of concern (what you worry about) and the circle of influence (what you can change). Focus on the overlapping part.
- We'd be crazy to want to face difficulty in life. But we'd be equally crazy to think that it isn't going to happen. Prepare for it and plan for the worst. The idea of premeditation of adversity is to repeatedly imagine potentially "bad" scenarios in advance, so that they will not catch you by surprise, and you'll be able to face them calmly and act according to virtue.
- Stoic ideas inevitably lead to greater mindfulness.
- Accept rather than fight every little thing.
- Judge yourself accurately and honestly.
- Causes (stress, overwhelm) are within us. Don't blame people or circumstances. You (most of the times) have a choice.
