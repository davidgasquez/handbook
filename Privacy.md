# Privacy

- [Privacy is about power](https://www.privacyguides.org/en/basics/why-privacy-matters/), and human information confers power over human beings.
- If we care about being authentic, fulfilled, and free humans, we have to care about the rules that apply to information about us.
- [A society with no privacy is a severe disadvantage in any resistance against the oppressive tendencies of the state and other large corporate actors.](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/188v2ao/why_is_privacy_important_to_you/)
  - Think about how badly things can go if the wrong people end up in positions of power.
  - What happens when someone is being stalked by an abusive ex-partner who works in law enforcement and has access to those databases?
- Data mining can be a weapon.
- Privacy is the assurance that your data is only seen by the parties you intend to view it.
- Anonymity is the ability to act without a persistent identifier.
  - Pseudonymity is a persistent identifier.
- You shouldn't confuse privacy with secrecy. We know what happens in the bathroom, but you still close the door.
- There are always certain facts about us, say, personal health information, or sexual behavior, that we wouldn't want the whole world to know.
- [Less privacy => you give more data to advertisers => you get more personalized ads => ads are more effective on you => political ads change your opinions more => your political views are partly bought by money.](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/188v2ao/why_is_privacy_important_to_you/). Ads work, on everyone, regardless what you think.
- You may be fine with being influenced by ads, but you are also imposing it on everyone you care about, without their consent.
- Companies can see all your data, and companies are made of people, and people can be malicious.
- Companies can share your innocuous data with law enforcement and get you arrested for being in the wrong place at the wrong time.
- Any information that is tied to your person can be used against you if it lands in the wrong person's hands. Privacy is safety.
- Digital privacy is even more paramount than social non-digital privacy, because it can be accessed or exploited remotely from anywhere.
- You behave very differently when you know you are being watched. A lack of privacy changes how you act.
- You do have things to hide. You do not know what you need to hide today for the reality of tomorrow.
