# Feedback Loops

- [Every action creates an equal and opposite reaction. **When reactions loop back to affect themselves, a feedback loop is created**.](https://fs.blog/2011/10/mental-model-feedback-loops/)
- There are two types of feedback loops: positive and negative.
  - Positive feedback amplifies system output, resulting in growth or decline.
  - Negative feedback dampers output, stabilizes the system around an equilibrium point.
- **[[Network Effects|Things are connected]]**. Changing one variable in a [[Systems|system]] will affect other variables in that system and other systems. This is important because it means that designers must not only consider particular elements of a design, but also their relation to the design as a whole and to the greater environment.
- All complex [[systems]] are subject to positive and negative feedback loops whereby A causes B, which in turn influences A (and C), and so on – with higher-order effects frequently resulting from continual movement of the loop.
- Feedback loops vary in their accuracy.
  - Accurate feedback means that it **reliably** and **clearly** tells you when you do something right. If you get the quadratic formula wrong, you can check the right formula and know what was wrong.
  - Inaccurate feedback loop means that the results of the evaluation phase are “**noisy**” and contain significant variance, so the next cycle will need to take that into account. E.g: playing bowls without a coach.
    - Learning under conditions of noisy data starts with world construction. Imagine a possible future, and repeat this to generate hundreds of possible future worlds. The main skills and resources required are creativity, [[slack]], and [equanimity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equanimity). Creativity leads to a higher rate of idea generation and [[slack]] gives us more time to generate ideas. Equanimity is important because it allows us to persevere in the absence of tangible feedback.
- [The shorter and more accurate the feedback loop, the easier it is to learn](http://web.archive.org/web/20240425163013/https://brianlui.dog/2020/05/10/beware-of-tight-feedback-loops/). The **tighter** your feedback loop, the better your work.
  - Fast and accurate loops might get you on a local maximum or might not work when the underlying system is noisy.

## Examples

- Poor kids becoming rich adults. Then, they raise rich kids that don't share the same [[Values]] that made the parents rich.
- Artist making music while they experience life without fame. Once fame gets in they don't have the same life experience and can't produce the same type of music.
- [The Mongol Empire was an unification of many nomadic tribes. They were unstoppable for a while until they started to become more civilized. The thing that made them unstoppable (nomadic and "uncivilized") stopped being a part of their [[Culture]] and the empire began to break down.](https://www.dancarlin.com/product/hardcore-history-wrath-of-the-khans-series/)
- The [[Science#Metascience]] learning loop: trial new social processes → evaluate effectiveness → scale successful approaches → amplify transformative changes. A positive feedback loop designed to systematically improve how science itself operates.
