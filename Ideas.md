# Ideas

A few personal random ideas. A multitude of bad ideas is necessary for one good idea!

### Key Properties of Ideas

- Timeless.
- No replication costs.
- Creates win-win situations.
- [[Network Effects]].

### Interesting Areas

- [[Open Data]]
- [[Governance]]
- [[Programming]]
- [[Web3]]
- [[Learning]]
- Science (biology, astrophysics, neuro, ...)

## Awesome Game

- Modular Approach. The idea is to have a main character and multiple shards to play. Each shard could implement a different rule set or genre.
- [[Modularity]] could also be implemented in the graphic side. You can choose the graphics pack you like just like another cosmetic.
- Player Driven Economy. Everything is made by players and traded for real life currency. The developers only get a fee for each trade. This makes the game fully F2P but also supports the developers.
- Companion Apps. Some tasks like trading or [[Planning]] could be done from a mobile device.
- Systems (items, skills, monsters, ...) could be affected by evolutionary processes.
	- Merging two skills could produce a new one (inheriting properties and perhaps with a small mutation)
	- Monsters will develop resistance against what's killing them.
	- Quests rewards will also change dynamically.
- Players can vote for the next patch changes with in game money. This way developers gets feedback on what's important.
- Could have a GPS RPG extension. Locations in the real world would be named similarly to the real place but with a twist given by a Neural Network.
- Factions can take control of a region and build new things there.

## Unconventional Changelogs

- What if each city or town had a changelog? What changed in the last _release_? Did it change a street direction or opened a new commerce?
- What if stores had a changelog? That'd mean price history for each product and also new products would be easier to find.

## Fake Currencies

- A chores app where kids could earn a currency. This could be traded for rewards like going to the cinema or getting a new PC game.

## Open Knowledge

- Research.
	- Each publication is a repository, where people can contribute to make corrections.
- Distillation. Deeply digesting ideas, and putting them together into a framework of thinking.
	- Made by a small number of people with a strong vision and a deep investment in the article.
- Publication.
	- Should have different resolutions. E.g: Blog post for the general public, article for the scientific community, paper for the raw idea.

## Personal Knowledge Base

A tool and framework to manage knowledge. This will allow compound learning and make it easier to discover new abstractions or connections between concepts. These are the key properties of my ideal PKB (could replace this handbook):

- Simple, Open Source and multi-platform. Works offline and has a backup mechanism similar to [[Git]].
- Focus on capturing ideas and content as fast as possible.
- Should be managed as a graph:
	- Nodes are notes or smaller graphs. [Notes should be atomic, concept-oriented and densely linked](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C).
	- Bidirectional links connecting nodes.
	- Nodes could have several parents (concepts).
	- Users can remix and connect ideas in multiple overlapping hierarchies.
- [Each concept could be linked to external content (video, book, audio)](https://www.notion.so/Models-bb0f4bfd3cd140b3a00cd955e61003f9).
	- Content should have tags (related concepts)
- Can be made public.
- Personal Knowledge bases can be personal [ontologies with similar core components (individuals, classes, attributes, relations, ...)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_components).

Instead of building the tool, we can start with a standard protocol and let other tools (Roam, Notion, Obsidian) use that.

### Open Source Projects

- [Logseq](https://logseq.com/).
- [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so/).
- [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/).
- [Noosphere](https://github.com/subconsciousnetwork/noosphere)

## City Discovery

- Create an activity similar to a gymkhana mixed with escape room. Players have to solve riddles and puzzles while learning about the city and its history.
- There might be digital and real life puzzles.
- Clues might be scattered across many checkpoints with actors as "NPC"s to guide the players.
- For big and closed areas, set up a Photo Battle Royale. You're out in a park. Make a group chat and eliminate people by making photos of them. The goal is to collect trophies without being eliminated.

## Social Network Improvements

- [[Federated Networks |Federate and open source current networks]] to improve communities.
	- [The protocol should evolve differently for each community](https://youtu.be/P-2P3MSZrBM?t=5953). Communities will mix and match protocols (rules, monetization, rewarding, actions, [[governance]], ...) to make the protocol fit their network.
- We need a social network that does not cause divisiveness and negativity that is currently the natural by-product of optimizing for greater engagement.
- How can the network [[Incentives |incentivize]] healthy conversations and encourage nuanced [[Resolving Disagreement |discussions]]?

## Web3 Recommendation Engine

- Since Ethereum wallets are public, you can get good data on which tokens people similar to you are holding.
- This might be useful to discover new assets.

## Web3 Data Pipelines

- There is no Airbyte for blockchains.
- Everyone is reinventing the wheel, e.g: Dune does ETL, Flipside does it too, ...

## Structured Company Changelog

- Create and maintain a *Company Changelog* in a table (structured and parse-able format) so it can be fed to something like Mixpanel or joined to other datasets to do analysis.
- Add data from other Sources:
	- Github PRs
	- OKRs
- Use something like GitHub Releases to publish the changes and artifacts.
