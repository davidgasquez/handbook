## Cats
 
- Get a brush and brush your kitty! It's recommended that short haired cats should be brushed once a week.
- It's recommended to let your kitty eat as much as it wills, until it reaches adulthood. They need to grow big and strong!
- Buy a scratching post and other scratching toys to encourage them to scratch the right surfaces. Catnip also helps.
- Slowly blinking at cats says "I'm comfortable around you" and is a show of contentment and non hostility.
- Do things at roughly the same time every day, and stick to a schedule. they operate their entire lives off their schedule, and will be more reasonable if you are consistent with doing their stuff.
- Toys, buy a variety at first to see what your cat likes.
- Wet food, not dry food since dry food will make their bodies work too hard and put your cat into a constant state of dehydration.
Have one of the playing sessions right before the last meal of the day. A good hunt ends with a hefty meal. After a quick grooming session, she'll sleep like an angel, allowing  you to do the same.
