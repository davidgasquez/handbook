# Gardening

- Know your soil. Understanding the type of soil in your garden is crucial to determining which plants will thrive, and which won't.
- Use a watering can or a soaker hose to deliver water directly to the roots, and avoid getting the leaves wet.
- Soak weeds in a container to extract nutrient. Water your plants with that every now and then. If it looks sad, it needs water (a good rule for houseplants and humans).
