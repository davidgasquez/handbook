# Gardening

- Know your soil. Understanding the type of soil in your garden is crucial to determining which plants will thrive, and which won't.
- Use a watering can or a soaker hose to deliver water directly to the roots, and avoid getting the leaves wet.
- Soak weeds in a container to extract nutrients. Water your plants with that every now and then. If it looks sad, it needs water (a good rule for houseplants and humans).
- Adopt [permaculture principles](https://youtu.be/acjpwIxZzlA), which mimic patterns found in nature to create a self-sustaining ecosystem. The 12 principles are:
  - Observe and interact.
  - Catch and store energy. For example, capturing rain water.
  - Obtain a yield.
  - Apply self-regulation and accept feedback.
  - Use and value renewable resources and services.
  - Produce no waste.
  - Design from patterns to details.
  - Integrate rather than segregate.
  - Use small and slow solutions.
  - Use and value diversity.
  - Use edges and value the marginal.
  - Creatively use and respond to change.
