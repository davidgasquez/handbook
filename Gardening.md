# Gardening

- Know your soil. Understanding the type of soil in your garden is crucial to determining which plants will thrive, and which won't. Test your soil's pH level and nutrient content, and amend it if necessary to create the best growing conditions for your plants.
- Use a watering can or a soaker hose to deliver water directly to the roots, and avoid getting the leaves wet.
- Soak weeds in a container to extract nutrient. Water your plants with that every now and then.
