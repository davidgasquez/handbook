# Meetings

Meetings are essential for brainstorming and group decision-making, but they often become unproductive [[Time]] sinks. Creating an exceptional meeting [[Culture]] requires intentionality and clear practices.

## Common Meeting Problems

- [Too many meetings with unclear value lead to productivity loss](https://abitmighty.com/posts/the-ultimate-meeting-culture)
- Meetings tend to be slow and unproductive without proper structure
- [Large meetings make active participation difficult for most attendees](https://abitmighty.com/posts/the-ultimate-meeting-culture)
- People attend due to FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) rather than genuine need

## Host Best Practices

- [Meetings should be as short, focused, and small as possible](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/10/01/the-low-information-diet/comment-page-5/).
- [Include detailed agenda with time estimates for each item](https://abitmighty.com/posts/the-ultimate-meeting-culture)
- [Schedule meetings ending at :50 to allow breaks between meetings](https://abitmighty.com/posts/the-ultimate-meeting-culture)
- The host is typically the moderator, unless otherwise determined.
- Nominate a note-taker prior to the start of the meeting.
- Share a draft agenda prior to the meeting (with consideration for time zones)
- Review the agenda at the top of the meeting, asking for other items and the order.
- During the meeting, collect to-do's, blockers/asks, and DRIs.
- [Take clear minutes documenting all decisions made](https://abitmighty.com/posts/the-ultimate-meeting-culture)
- [End meetings on time to respect everyone's schedule](https://abitmighty.com/posts/the-ultimate-meeting-culture)
- You can add [[feedback]] as an agenda item, and ask the participants to take a few minutes to jot down feedback for the next meeting.
- When asking for a meeting, send a message with:
  1. **Purpose.** State reason for meeting. Include necessary information, links, context, ...
  2. **Duration.** State restrictions (i.e. "at least 30 min", "at most 50min").
  3. **Date.** State restrictions (i.e. "must happen before Aug 8.")
  4. **Suggestions.** Pick three reasonable choices given restrictions and suggest them up front.

## [Attendee Best Practices](https://abitmighty.com/posts/the-ultimate-meeting-culture)

- Only attend meetings if genuinely interested and can contribute
- Prepare in advance by reviewing agenda and related materials
- Actively participate in discussions rather than passively listening
- Decline meetings when appropriate - it's better than attending without engagement
- Read meeting minutes if not attending to stay informed

## Update Meetings

- Progress: what did I accomplish this week?
- Plans: What tasks am I doing next week?
- Problems: what is blocking progress?
- Other: what else should the team know?

## Decision Meetings

- Progress on achieving current quarterly objectives.
- How the product is being received in the market.
- How the most important customers are succeeding (or not) using the product.
- How the team is performing and any people changes needed.
- Financial position of the company and review of metrics.

## Meeting Culture Recommendations

- Prioritize written [[Communication]] for knowledge sharing over meetings
- Make it culturally acceptable to enter/leave meetings strategically
- Create a culture where declining meetings without guilt is normal
- Focus on creating intentional, purposeful meetings rather than habitual ones
- "The goal of an exceptional meeting culture is to allow for people to constructively decline meetings by fully understanding the consequences of their action"
