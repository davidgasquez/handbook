# Meetings

- [Meetings should be as short, focused, and small as possible](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/10/01/the-low-information-diet/comment-page-5/).
- The host is typically the moderator, unless otherwise determined.
- Nominate a note-taker prior to the start of the meeting.
- Share a draft agenda prior to the meeting (with consideration for time zones)
- Review the agenda at the top of the meeting, asking for other items and the order.
- During the meeting, collect to-do’s, blockers/asks, and DRIs.
- You can add “feedback” as an agenda item, and ask the participants to take a few minutes to jot down feedback for the next meeting.
- When asking for a meeting, send a message with:
	1. **Purpose.** State reason for meeting. Include necessary information, links, context, ...
	2. **Duration.** State restrictions (i.e. "at least 30 min", "at most 50min").
	3. **Date.** State restrictions (i.e. "must happen before Aug 8.")
	4. **Suggestions.** Pick three reasonable choices given restrictions and suggest them up front.
