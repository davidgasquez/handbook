# Health

**How you live** affects **how long** and **how happy** you live. So, don't [maximize misery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO1mTELoj6o). Your health has an impact on everyone around you too. You get healthy, and more importantly stay healthy, by accumulating significant, but livable, [[Life Advice|improvements to your lifestyle over time]], and building on that.

- Run experiments and try new things. This will make you explore the world so you can exploit it later. Go for variety and surprise. Don't keep doing the same thing.

Therefore prioritizing health (like it or not, you're a physical object), [[Sleep]], [[Fitness|exercise]], and other such aspects will always pay off far more than what you sacrifice on them. [These areas should take priority over anything else](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QTkij5fmPXPd7GD4Z/review-of-scott-adams-how-to-fail-at-almost-everything-and).
- Our bodies and minds are built to live in a tribe in 50,000BC, which leaves modern humans with a number of unfortunate traits (fixation with [[Social Media Issues|tribal-style social survival]], attracted to [[Nutrition|energy dense food]], ...).
- Build [[Systems]] to take the right actions effortlessly through [[Habits]].
