# Engineering Process

1. **Issue driven development**. Always create an issue and assign it to you for anything you work on. If it is worth spending time on, it is worth creating an issue for it since that enables other people to learn and help. You can always edit the description or close it when the problem is something different or disappears.
2. When working on an issue, make sure that contains the latest information. The issue should be the source of truth.
3. After a discussion related to an issue update the issue body with the consensus or final conclusions. This makes it much easier to see the current state of an issue for everyone involved in the implementation and prevents confusion later on.
4. Submit the smallest item of work that makes sense. When creating an issue describe the smallest fix possible, put suggestions for enhancements in separate issues and link them.
5. Do not leave issues open for a long time, issues should be actionable and realistic. If an issue has been addressed or is not relevant anymore, close it. If someone disagrees, they can re-open it and explain what is still relevant.
6. If you complete part of an issue and need someone else to take the next step, re-assign the issue to that person.
7. When working on an issue, ask for [[Feedback]] from your peers. Try to get a [review](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/code-review) of your work. Even a quick look could do it. If they suggest changes, you get the opportunity to improve. This promotes [[Git#How to make a good Pull Request |collaboration and advances everyone's]] skills.
