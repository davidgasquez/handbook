# Themes

To better accomplish positive life change, [give yourself a theme](https://youtu.be/NVGuFdX5guE). A theme will be easy to follow and will impact your [[Habits |daily actions]]. Without knowing where you want to go you just wonder. Resolutions give us the feeling of failure, themes gives us chances to apply them. A good theme can't fail. Themes don't have very defined [[Goals]].

Just having a theme in your mind will change the way you think. You'll notice paths that weren't there before. Broad themes gives flexibility. Pick a broad directional idea that resonates with you and run with it. Themes can be as long or short as you need. These are some theme ideas:

- Order
- Simplicity
- Novelty
- Experiments
- Joy
- Health
- Finances
- Discipline
- Growth
- People
- Knowledge
- Nature
- Reflection
- Iteration
- Attention
- Foundation

[The goal is to continually make some progress on areas of your life that are important but not urgent](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25582580). The things you want to focus on are the trend lines. Don't obsess on the results of specific projects/[[Goals]]. Are your trend lines moving in the right direction?

You don't need to limit themes to yourself. Can be applied to other things like trips, [[Relationships]], places, ...
