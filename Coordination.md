# Coordination

- Human coordination in groups ([[Teamwork]], [[Cooperatives]], [[Decentralized Autonomous Organizations]]) to achieve aims is the secret sauce of human civilization. If it could be engineered, a lot of problems would have been solved.
  - Coordination problems are a [constraint to production of all kinds of economic value](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/P6fSj3t4oApQQTB7E/coordination-as-a-scarce-resource).
  - All problems are coordination problems. Moloch is at the end of all!
  - The Second Law of Consulting: No matter how it looks at first, it's always a people problem.
- [Coordination](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2020/09/11/coordination.html), the ability for large [[Teamwork|groups of actors to work together]] for their common interest, is one of the most powerful forces in the universe. It can be improved in many ways:
  - Faster spread of information.
  - Better norms that identify what behaviors are classified as cheating along with more effective punishments.
  - Stronger and more powerful [[organizations]].
  - Tools like smart contracts that allow interactions with reduced levels of trust.
  - [[Governance]] technologies (voting, shares, decision markets...).
- Groups either coordinate around principles, coordinate around a task (powerful but temporary), or coordinate around a leader.
  - Principles are factories of tasks and more resilient than leaders.
- [Keep the work parallel, the groups small, and the resources local.](https://codahale.com/work-is-work/) If possible, factor work products into independent modules; if not, grow slowly and optimize.
- Trust increases coordination. To increase trust:
  1. Repeat interactions.
  2. Look for possible win-wins.
  3. Communicate clearly and [stablish common context](https://gestalt.cafe/trust-infrastructure/).
- Trust is foundational to civilization, enabling coordination across time and distance. The internet has eroded traditional trust mechanisms by:
  - Reducing the surface area for trust-building
  - Expanding social contexts beyond our capacity to maintain relationships
  - Separating information from its contextual moorings
- Radical transparency is not an effective substitute for trust. It often constrains well-intentioned behavior while bad actors find ways to circumvent it.
- Trust is built gradually through iterated interactions, with two main shortcuts:
  - Credible commitments (escrow, contracts, penalties)
  - Common context and proof of historical behavior
- Modern [trust infrastructure](https://gestalt.cafe/trust-infrastructure/) needs to solve three key problems:
  - **Contextual richness**: Sharing metadata alongside information
  - **Expressibility**: Transforming data while preserving meaning
  - **Audience control**: Sharing different information with different groups
- The best process is no process! In an ideal state it all just works and everything flows. [Adding a couple of checks seems simple but that affects everyone in that process](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28710193).
  - No [[processes]] requires trusting other people. More trust means better coordination without processes. [Trust is the currency of interactions](https://youtu.be/-vbPXbm8eTw).
  - When a process becomes the proxy for the result you want, you stop looking at outcomes and just make sure you're doing the process right.
  - Every process will slow you down, and some will make you better.
- If we imagine human society as its own organism. We need processes and other coordination tools to make it remove the hand from the fire when it starts to burn.
      - The hand doesn't know what to do, but relays information to the brain, that makes the appropriate changes.
  - Something similar could be achieved at a society level, where pain triggers processes that make it stop.
- Only a few bits of information are possible to reliably convey to a large number of people. [The larger the group, the smaller the message needs to be](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4ZvJab25tDebB8FGE/you-get-about-five-words).
- The requirements to govern a commons without tragedy:
  - [Clear boundaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom#%22Design_principles_illustrated_by_long-enduring_CPR_(Common_Pool_Resource)_institutions%22).
  - Managed by locals.
    - In a small community, everybody knows everybody, and can keep track of what they do. This makes small groups iterated games which rewards trust and penalizes sociopath behavior.
  - Community makes its own rules.
  - Community can monitor behavior.
  - Graduated sanctions for those who violate community rules.
  - Cheap, accessible means of conflict resolution.
  - Self-determination.
- There are many [coordination mechanisms](https://coordinationmechanisms.gitcoin.co/). Choose the appropriate one for your situation.
- [There is no such thing as a structureless group](https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm).
  - We are individuals, with different talents, predispositions, and backgrounds.
  - The idea of "structurelessness" does not prevent the formation of informal structures, it becomes a way of masking power.
  - Make the group structure explicit, not implicit. The rules of decision-making must be open and available to everyone, and this can happen only if they are formalized. Having an established process for decision-making ensures that everyone can participate in it to some extent.
- [The more you need consensus, the less work you can do](http://hintjens.com/blog:100).
- A way to coordinate without trust is relying on [[Blockchain]] and [[Cryptocurrencies]].
- Coordinating is better than who takes the resources. The more you can coordinate, the more resources you can take ([Paretotopia](https://youtu.be/1lqBra8r468)). Keep this in mind when making decisions and negotiating.
- [Ability to coordinate](https://thecompendium.cards/c/coordination-as-form-of-power) is a form of power.
- [Collusion](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2019/04/03/collusion.html) is the dark side of coordination, where a subset of people coordinate against the interests of a broader group.
  - Cannot be detected by looking at actions alone, as the same actions can be legitimate or collusive depending on context and intentions.
  - Requires specific countermeasures like deliberate decentralization, skin-in-the-game mechanisms, and fostering counter-coordination (e.g., forking in blockchain systems).
  - Examples include price fixing between sellers, vote buying, and 51% attacks on blockchains.
  - Any mechanism that helps under-coordinated parties coordinate will also help already-coordinated parties over-coordinate to extract value.
- Explore [Cooperative Governance](https://nadia.xyz/voting) ideas. It offers an elegant compromise between on-chain and off-chain governance: you have a failure outcome that's enforced and "real", but the process of consensus remains firmly in the hands of people.
- There are [interventions](https://www.prosocialdesign.org/) to help online spaces bring out the best in human nature online (deleting a comment that breaks a forum's rules, a reminder of the community rules, ...). This helps build trust and coordination.
