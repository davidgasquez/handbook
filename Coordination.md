# Coordination

- Human coordination in groups to achieve aims is the secret sauce of human civilization. If it could be engineered, a lot of problems would have been solved.
	- Coordination problems are a [constraint to production of all kinds of economic value](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/P6fSj3t4oApQQTB7E/coordination-as-a-scarce-resource).
	- All problems are coordination problems. Moloch is at the end of all!
- [Coordination](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/09/11/coordination.html), the ability for large [[Teamwork | groups of actors to work together]] for their common interest, is one of the most powerful forces in the universe. It can be improved in many ways:
	- Faster spread of information.
	- Better norms that identify what behaviors are classified as cheating along with more effective punishments.
	- Stronger and more powerful [[organizations]].
	- Tools like smart contracts that allow interactions with reduced levels of trust.
	- [[Governance]] technologies (voting, shares, decision markets...)
- [Keep the work parallel, the groups small, and the resources local.](https://codahale.com/work-is-work/) If possible, factor work products into independent modules; if not, grow slowly and optimize.
- The best process is no process! In an ideal state it all just works and everything flows. [Adding a couple of checks seems simple but that affects everyone in that process](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28710193).
	- No [[processes]] requires trusting other people. More trust means better coordination without processes. [Trust is the currency of interactions](https://youtu.be/-vbPXbm8eTw).
	- When a process becomes the proxy for the result you want, you stop looking at outcomes and just make sure you're doing the process right.
	- Every process will slow you down, and some will make you better.
- If we imagine human society as it's own organism. We need processes and other coordination tools to make it remove the hand from the fire when it starts to burn.
	- The hand doesn't know what to do, but relies information to the brain, that makes the appropriate changes. 
	- Something similar could be achieved at a society level, where pain triggers processes that make it stop.
