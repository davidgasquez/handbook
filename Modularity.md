# Modularity

Modularity is a property of [[systems]]. It means:

- Loosely coupling. Breaking a chair shouldn't break the dinner!
- Multiple parts that play well together. This allows systems to develop [[emergence]].
- Dividing a large systems into multiple smaller competing ones will make them evolve different rule-set and will allow you to pick the best one.
