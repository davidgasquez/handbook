# Writing
![[Quotes#^645051]]

- Writing things down helps clarifying [[Ideas]]. One of the tests of whether you understand something is whether you can explain it to someone else. [Writing doesn't just communicate ideas; it generates them](http://www.paulgraham.com/writing44.html).
	- Writing down your ideas shows you whether they have substance. Detecting when you're wrong is the first step to becoming right. There are many ways to record thought. Writing is the best for improving your [[Thinking]].
	- Ideas can feel complete. It's only when you try to [put them into words](http://paulgraham.com/words.html) that you discover they're not. If you never subject your ideas to that test, you'll not only never have fully formed ideas, but also never realize it.
	- [Drawing can help visualize ideas](https://ralphammer.com/how-to-draw-ideas/).
- [Style is a small part of writing well. Most of writing is thinking clearly.](https://www.julian.com/guide/write/intro) The act of simply putting a thought into words makes it immediately obvious to you if you really understand it or not, and if not, where your blind spots are. For style:
	- **Be concise**. Understand the topic you're writing about. [Use simple words and sentences](http://www.paulgraham.com/simply.html). Put the most important things first. Never use a long word when a short one will do.
	- **Be Useful**. Before you start writing, ask yourself: What purpose does this serve? Who is going to read it? What do they need to know?
	- **Be specific**. Avoid vague language (remove qualifiers). Cut the fluff. Delete unnecessary words. Say what you mean. Make positive statements about reality.
	- **Be consistent**.
	- **Add rhythm**. Vary the sentence length to break the monotony.
- Use the active voice.
- Write in a conversational tone. Think about readers when writing.
- [Divide things into small chunks and if you have multiple points in a text, number them to make replies easier](https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/02/20/writing-advice/). List the points you want to make in a logical order. This allows you to remove the clutter and avoid confusion. Use the [Minto Pyramid](https://scqa.lifeitself.org/) or another standard structure like this one:
	- Define a clear thesis. State the main point before you
	give the reasoning that leads to it.
	- Support your thesis with arguments.
	- Declare and reject the antithesis.
	- Conclusions.
- Use positive language rather than negative language.
- Human beings are wired to respond to storytelling. A story arc is a way to structure ideas to tap into this response, typically by describing a change in the world. This applies to everything, e.g: [[Public Speaking]]
- Don't fully think through your ideas before writing. It's inefficient. The best way to think is by writing. It compels your brain to connect the dots. [Write whatever helps you think better](https://twitter.com/eugeneyan/status/1256828197410201601).
- [Don’t try to _persuade_ people that the idea is true/good. Instead, try to accurately _describe_ where the idea came from, the path which led _you_ to think it’s true/plausible/worth a look. In the process, you’ll probably convey your own actual level of uncertainty, which is exactly the right thing to do.](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Psr9tnQFuEXiuqGcR/how-to-write-quickly-while-maintaining-epistemic-rigor)
- Separate the processes of creation from improving. **You can't write and edit**. Write the first draft fast, then iterate on it editing things. Much of this editing will be cutting, and that makes simple writing even simpler.
- [Beware of "this"](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5e49dHLDJoDpeXGnh/editing-advice-for-lesswrong-users). Scan your words for words like "this" or "that", and when in doubt about clarity, replace them with whatever their intended antecedents are.
- You can use tools like [Hemingway](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/) or [Ludwig](https://ludwig.guru/) to improve.
- When writing tutorials or guides, use the second-person and describe actions to a user. These types of content talks to people when humans can't. [Technical documentation follows the same rules than normal writing](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one).
	- [Make it fun](https://davnicwil.com/tips-for-making-writing-more-fun/)!
- The skills you learn by writing transfer to speaking. Being good at speaking makes you more persuasive.
- If it's not written down, it's not.
- Good nonfiction has three qualities.
	1. It gets to the point.
	2. It is interesting. Written from your own experience, in your personal voice.
	3. It is grounded in reality.


## Executable Writing

[If you have already written lots of concept-oriented atomic around the topic, your task is more like editing than composition. You can make an outline by shuffling the note titles, write notes on any missing material, and edit them together into a narrative.](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3PBVkZ2SvsAgFXkjHsycBeyS6Cw1QXf7kcD8)

Instead of having a task like “write an outline of the first chapter,” you have a task like “find notes which seem relevant.” Each step feels doable.
