# Documentation

- If your product/tool/process documentation is not good enough, people will not use it.
- The documentation for a project should live in the same repository as the code itself.
  - Update documentation in lockstep when updating the codebase.
  - Documentation should beÂ **versioned**.
  - Documentation changes should be reviewed in the same way as your code.
- [Documentation](https://diataxis.fr/) needs to include and be structured around its four different functions: [tutorials, how-to guides, technical reference and explanation](https://documentation.divio.com/introduction/). Each of them requires a distinct mode of writing.
  - A tutorial is learning-oriented, allows the newcomer to get started, similar to a lesson. E.g: teaching a small child how to cook.
  - A how-to guide is goal-oriented, shows how to solve a specific problem with a series of steps. E.g: a recipe in a cookery book.
  - An explanation is understanding-oriented, provides background and context. E.g: an article on culinary social history.
  - A reference guide is information-oriented, describes the machinery and is accurate and complete. E.g: a reference encyclopedia article.
- [If someone's having to read your docs, it's not "simple"](https://justsimply.dev/). Remove filler words.
- [Principles to keep in mind when writing documentation](https://mkaz.blog/misc/notes-on-technical-writing/).
  - The purpose of technical writing is to help users accomplish tasks as quickly and effectively as possible.
  - People learn by doing, prefer to be shown and not told.
  - Get users to their first success quickly.
  - There is more than one type of documentation.
  - [Use second person](https://developers.google.com/style/person): "you" rather than "we".
  - Keep it simple, write in plain language.
  - [Use active voice](https://developers.google.com/style/voice): make clear who's performing the action.
- [As you are working in a team, then you have to address the problem of shared understanding](https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2022/11/24/writing-docs-well-why-should-a-software-engineer-care/). This is where documentation come in.
- [Use the imperative mood in descriptions and instructions](https://twitter.com/kepano/status/1751354613041872985). Use concise action-oriented sentences, written from the user's perspective.
  - When writing instructions, anywhere you say "You should X" or "You can X," replace it with the imperative mood of the verb.
- Ask the below two questions before writing:
  1. Who am I writing this for?
  2. What are the top 1-3 takeaways after someone's read?
- [Write simply](https://zodvik.com/posts/on-writing-well/):
  - Use fewer than 30 words per sentence
  - Use ordinary words and simple sentences
  - Remove fluff
  - Remove weasel words. Replace adjectives with data or details.
  - Ask the "So what" question to every sentence that you write.
  - Prefer active voice to passive.
- Most docs are short-lived and used for point-in-time discussions. However, some documents serve for a longer time. To have your writing stand the test of time, avoid using references that change with time or location.
