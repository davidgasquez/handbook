# Finances

- Today's savings buy tomorrow's liberty. Think long term. [A dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow](https://putanumonit.com/2017/02/10/get-rich-slowly/). People will take that dollar and do something profitable with it. Financial safety is freedom.
- Saving money and investing money are both good [[Habits]]. Small amounts of money invested regularly for many decades without deliberation is one path to wealth.
- [Be boring with most of your portfolio](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1743991285214527532).
- Spend (relatively) more money on things you interact with the most, time-wise (as well as intensity-wise).
- Up to a point, being richer will not necessarily make you happier.
- Spend on others, especially people you are close to. Positive feedback loop: Prosocial spending makes you happier, and happiness makes you more likely to spend pro-socially.
