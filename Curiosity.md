# Curiosity

![[Quotes#^307613]]

- Never stop [[learning]], practice [[Thinking|rational thinking]] and internalize [[mental models]] and other concepts that will help you think more effectively.
- Knowledge is a powerful tool. The more you [feel like a noob](http://paulgraham.com/noob.html), the better. Feeling stupid now is better than feeling stupid in 10 years.
- [Reality has a surprising amount of detail](http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail). Knowing more about the world makes you enjoy it more. [Understanding how music is made increases the pleasure you get from music](https://youtu.be/JbVfcZxfIZo).
  - Real things exist in essentially infinite resolution. [Looking closer always reveals more, and it's often not what you'd expect](https://www.raptitude.com/2023/10/the-truth-is-always-made-of-details/).
- Do stuff! Whatever it is you work on, is worthwhile as long as you share your learnings. In the worst case, if your [[ideas]] don't work out, the community will learn why that approach doesn't make sense.
  - Remix ideas. Ideas are impacted by [[evolution]]. The most useful ones survive and evolve. [Innovation is the product of combinations of ideas](https://youtu.be/XUAIIQFoufs). Everything is a remix!
  - Fail early and often. There is only one guaranteed way you won't get something you want, and that's not to pursue it. [Mistakes](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/So_you%27ve_made_a_mistake_and_it%27s_public...) are the portals of discovery.
  - [If you think you're going to regret not doing something, you should probably do it](https://blog.samaltman.com/the-days-are-long-but-the-decades-are-short). Most people regret far more things they didn't do than things they did do.
- [Find your way around the inertia of helpless mentality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMPzDiraNnA). You probably have control of more things than you think! Knowing this fact changes the way you see your circle of control.
- [Practice hunting for bugs](https://radimentary.wordpress.com/2018/01/29/hammertime-day-1-bug-hunt/?utm_source=pocket_mylist)! A bug is anything in life that needs improvement. Even if something is going well, if you can imagine it going better, there's a bug.
- Knowing what we really want is hard and takes effort. Explore yourself and your [[values]].
- Experiment more! It is very very easy to do what comes naturally and never deviate from that. Break the pattern.
- Consume content that is hard to produce. If the producer can spam the content, it is probably not worth your time. E.g: audiobooks vs podcasts.
