# Productivity

- Define the task requirements and [[Goals]] clearly.
- Done is better than perfect.
- Do the worst thing first. Give yourself a reward once you're done.
- Adopt a fixed volume approach to productivity.
	- Tough choices are inevitable; focus on making them consciously and well.
	- Create smaller chunks. This helps getting in the flow (find the right balance between the challenge of the activity and your own skills levels).
- Avoid multitasking. Focus on one big project at a time, and see it to completion before moving onto the next.
- Leverage the power of positive pressure by publicly committing to your goals.
- [Improve your environment](https://nesslabs.com/neuroscience-of-procrastination). Design your workspace in a way that minimizes distractions, whether physical or digital.
- **What is optimal for me won't be optimal for you**. You'll have to experiment to find out what works best for you.
- [[Journaling |Keep a log]] of what happened each day. You can also add what you've learned!
- Create [[Checklist]] for repetitive processes. For example, a [[Checklist]] detailing all the task to do before ending the day.
- "Where is the good knife?" If you're looking for your good X, you have bad Xs. Throw those out.
