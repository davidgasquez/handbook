# Mental Health

- When it comes to [mental health](https://jjbeshara.com/2020/06/04/mental-wealth/), our society approaches it like we did with physical health 50 years ago. We only think about it when something goes wrong.
- We benefit from approaching mental health like we invest in anything else in our lives ([[Finances]], [[Relationships]], careers, [[Fitness | physical health]], etc), where one builds wealth in this area by continuous, conscious investment.
- Be [[Mindfulness | grateful]] for all the people and things you have. Accept you're not in full control of your destiny. [Success depends on luck](https://youtu.be/3LopI4YeC4I). Luck is a function of surface area. More experiences generate more serendipity.
- Lots of little good things is the path to happiness. You want frequent boosts not rare big stuff.
- Maintain strong social ties. Social [[Relationships]] boost happiness. Sharing amazing experiences with those closest to you is as good as it gets.
- Be around nature. Have some houseplants as they improve mood.
- If you have trouble reading internal signals, try [debugging yourself](https://philome.la/jace_harr/you-feel-like-shit-an-interactive-self-care-guide/play/index.html).


## Aversion

Aversion is any sort of mental mechanism that causes us to be less likely to engage in a particular (mental as well as physical) activity, or to do so only with pain, displeasure, or discomfort. Pavlovian conditioning can cause humans to unconsciously flinch from even thinking about a serious personal problem ([Ugh Fields](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EFQ3F6kmt4WHXRqik/ugh-fields)) you might have.

Aversions can be conscious or unconscious, reasoned or felt, verbal or visceral, and they can range anywhere from a slight tinge of antipathy to outright phobias.

There are many reasons folks feel [helplessly blankness](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/puhPJimawPuNZ5wAR/learned-blankness) about understanding a given topic, including:
1. Simple habit. You are not used to thinking about it; and so you just automatically don’t.
2. Desire to avoid initial blunders that will force you to emotionally confront potential incompetence (as with my fear of writing fiction);
3. Avoidance of social conflict, or of status-claims; if your boss/friends/whoever will be upset by your disagreement, it may be more comfortable to “[not understand](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/11/30/salary)” the domain. 

If you’d like to reduce your learned blankness, try to [notice areas you care about, that you have been treating as blank defaults](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/puhPJimawPuNZ5wAR/learned-blankness#Notice_your_learned_blankness). Then, seed some thoughts in that area: set a timer, and write as many questions as you can about that topic before it beeps. 

Aversions are [[Problem Solving | decomposable problems]]. Break it down into
smaller pieces so that you can think about them separately one at a time and
solve them.
