# Nutrition

- Your *ideal* diet is unique. Everyone's body, nutritional needs are surprisingly different. What works for one person won't work for another.
- What you eat is one of the most important things to understand, given how much it affects the rest of your life. Diet is probably the most important single factor in your [[health]], body composition and overall appearance.
- Drink more water. Water regulates virtually every bodily process in some way. Drinking more water is a simple, virtually cost-free thing you can do to improve your overall [[health]].

## Cooking
