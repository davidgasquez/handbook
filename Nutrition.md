# Nutrition

- Your *ideal* diet (and weight) is unique. Everyone's body, nutritional needs are surprisingly different. What works for one person won't work for another.
- What [[Cooking|you eat]] is one of the most important things to understand given how much it affects the rest of your life. Diet is probably the most important single factor in your [[health]], body composition and overall appearance.
- Drink more water. Water regulates virtually every bodily process in some way. Drinking more water is a simple, virtually cost-free thing you can do to improve your overall [[health]].
- [Fasting can be useful in some situations](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/6demoi/why_you_should_try_intermittent_fasting_mood/).
  - Studies suggest a strong link between calorie restriction and longevity. Caloric restriction stimulates many beneficial cellular processes and is also beneficial as a weight-loss strategy.
- [Eat like an adult](https://thefitness.wiki/improving-your-diet/). Generally avoid processed foods, favor nuts and berries for snacks. **Eliminate sugars.**
  - [Beware of the ways the body deals with glucose](https://www.sumapositiva.com/p/curva-glucosa).
- [It's been shown that the timing of your meals and more specifically your protein intake, doesn't make any difference to the growth of your muscles. Just get adequate protein and calories throughout the day, though you might want to eat something post workout anyway for energy](https://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/9fxkof/if_you_eat_a_big_preworkout_meal_do_you_need_to/).
- Do a 15 minute walk after meals.
