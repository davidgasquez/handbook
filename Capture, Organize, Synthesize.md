# Capture, Organize, Synthesize

- [Capture as much as possible](http://gordonbrander.com/pattern/capture-organize-synthesize/). Your thoughts are more valuable than paper. Externalize what you [[Learning | learn]]. Once [[Ideas]] are captured in a tangible form you can begin surveying and manipulating them.
- Organize only after you capture. Filter, but don't delete irrelevant information. Computers are big enough to search and store everything. Make them manage it.
- Synthesize into new meaning. Re-contextualize what you learn. This is the creative act. Experience becomes art, notes become a novel.
