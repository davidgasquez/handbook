# Slack

- Slack is the absence of binding constraints on behavior.
- Lack of slack compounds. It gets harder to get out of that state over time.
- If you want to try things, you have to have the slack to pick up errors.
- Slack allows exploration.
- [Slack prevents desperation and helps planing for long term (by not having to put all the effort in the short term)](https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/09/30/slack/).
- When a part of a system lack slacks, it can't collaborate or help other parts.
- Adding slack to a system might make it more efficient.
- Make sure that under normal conditions _you_ have Slack. Value it. Guard it. Spend it only when Worth It. If you lose it, fight to get it back.
- [Slack creates _positive externalities_ for the group](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3qX2GipDuCq5jstMG/slack-has-positive-externalities-for-groups). In the other hand, is not properly valued by the group.
- Any system that must pass information between multiple, tightly integrated subsystems, there is a well understood concept of maximum sustainable load. We know that number to be roughly 60% of maximum possible load for all systems.

### Examples of Slack

- Money not budgeted for anything in particular, or which can easily be spent on something else instead, is financial slack.
- [[Time]] not scheduled for anything in particular, or which can easily be rescheduled, is time slack.
- Space not used for anything in particular, or which can easily be used for something else, is space slack.
- Capacity for excess stress is emotional slack.
- Multiple social groups which one can fall back on, or the ability to make new friends quickly, provide social slack
