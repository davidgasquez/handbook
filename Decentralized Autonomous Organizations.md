# Decentralized Autonomous Organizations

- A Decentralized Autonomous [[Organizations|Organization]] is a mechanism that enables online communities to form and coordinate economically.
- DAOs make it possible for an online group with members from anywhere in the world to pool capital and hard-code rules — entirely in software — for how that capital will be managed and deployed. Those rules are then enforced by the underlying blockchain.
