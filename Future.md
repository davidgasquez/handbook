# Things that might look weird in the future

History teaches us that in 100 years from now [[Openness | some of the assumptions we believed will turn out to be wrong]]. A good question to ask is "What might we be wrong about today?". These are a few things that future humans might see as weird behavior:

- Eat animals.
- Drive manually.
- Give birth without advanced assistance.
- Not caring for all the [animal suffering in the wild](https://longtermrisk.org/the-importance-of-wild-animal-suffering/).
	- Nature is not safe! The default is suffering. The current mentality is that nature is good and disruptions from nature are bad.
- The ignorance of Social Media and its [full impact on society](https://twitter.com/M_B_Petersen/status/1483457679800651787).
	- Is "being bad for society" an emergent property of social networks as they grow?
- Voting Systems and not using more Prediction Markets in public.
- More experimentation around [[Politics | governance]] (more charter cities). Cities are friendly to humans & wildlife, not cars.
- More experimentation around [[Learning]] and education (e.g: [teaching game theory](https://twitter.com/BoyanSlat/status/1469063939417907204) as a subject [in the modern curriculum](https://seths.blog/2021/09/the-modern-curriculum/))
	- More people aware of the trick our mind does to us ([Mind Field](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZRRxQcaEjA4qyEuYfAMCazlL0vQDkIj2) and [The Story Of Us](https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/08/story-of-us.html)) as well as [how diverse humans are](https://youtu.be/fC5qucSk18w).
