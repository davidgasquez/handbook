# Science

![[Quotes#^d54898]]

- Science itself isn't "true". It's a constantly refining process used to uncover truths based in material reality and that process is still full of mistakes. Do not treat science as a dogma, but rather as a refining process to uncover truths about reality.
- [Science is not clearly visible, like a comet bearing down on you](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/movie-review-dont-look-up). Science is like the Gnostic God. It exists, somewhere out there, perfect in itself. It is pure and right and beautiful. If you could hear it, it would certainly speak Truth. Yet here we are, in the stupid material universe, seeing through a glass darkly. Good sometimes looks like evil, evil often looks like good, and thereâ€™s some jerk with the head of a lion and the body of a snake psyching us out at every turn.
