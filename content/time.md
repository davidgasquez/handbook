# Time

Time is the most valuable and least replaceable resource. Life is short. Just like money, [time must be explicitly managed](https://youtu.be/oTugjssqOT0). If you get 10% more done and 1% better every day compared to someone else, the compounded difference is massive. Days are long but decades are short.

- Learn to prioritize, and value your time. "I don't have time" is another way of saying "it's not a priority".
  - [Separate decisions into four possibilities based on the type of decision](https://fs.blog/2018/09/decision-matrix/):
    1. Irreversible and inconsequential
    2. Irreversible and consequential. These are the ones that you really need to focus on.
    3. Reversible and inconsequential
    4. Reversible and consequential. Perfect decisions to run experiments and gather information.
- Lists help you to summarize your next steps and to not lose focus. If you place them in a very visible place it makes easier to accomplish goals.
  - Decompose lists items into smaller steps.
- Doing the same thing over and over again without getting tired is what computers are good at, humans have other skills.
- If a task takes less than [two minutes](https://jamesclear.com/how-to-stop-procrastinating), do it. It'll make you more productive and also unclutter your mind task's backlog.
- Do the tasks in the right order! One strategy might be starting with the one that could make the others irrelevant or easier.
- Doing one thing requires giving up another. Whenever you explicitly choose to do one thing, you implicitly choose not to do another thing.
- Success can be measured in the percentage of time you have under your control.
- Work expands to fill the time available. If you have six months to complete a task, it will take six months to complete. That's [Parkinson's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law).
- When you get an invitation to do something in the future, ask yourself: would you accept this if it was scheduled for tomorrow? Not too many promises will pass that immediacy filter.
- Routines speed up your life. Time will blow by quicker if you are covered in meaningless routines. What is worse, your days will become blurred - each day - too similar to the next - for you brain to hold on to distinct memories. On the other hand, routines also help to reduce decision fatigue so that you have room for more important decisions. Make sure the routines you have are the ones you need.

## Productivity

- Define the task requirements and goals clearly.
- Do the worst thing first. Give yourself a reward once you're done.
- Create smaller chunks. This helps getting in the flow (find the right balance between the challenge of the activity and your own skills levels). Avoid multitasking.
- Leverage the power of positive pressure by publicly committing to your goals.
- [Improve your environment](https://nesslabs.com/neuroscience-of-procrastination). Design your workspace in a way that minimizes distractions, whether physical or digital.
- What is optimal for me won't be optimal for you. You'll have to experiment to find out what works best for you.
- Keep a log of what happened each day. You can also add what you've learned!
- Create checklist for repetitive processes. For example, a checklist detailing all the task to do before ending the day.

## Focus

- Disable notifications and badges so that you don’t mindlessly open distracting apps.

## Investing

- Today's savings buy tomorrow's liberty. Think long term.
- Saving money and investing money are both good habits. Small amounts of money invested regularly for many decades without deliberation is one path to wealth.
- Before you get into investing, get into [budgeting](https://www.reddit.com/r/ynab/comments/8d4ab4/what_is_the_best_approach_for_budgeting_savings/).
