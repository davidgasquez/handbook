# Talking

- Smile and look at the eyes.
- Remove filler words.
- Speak with [[Openness | sincerity and passion]].
- Speak [slow](https://sive.rs/slow) and naturally. Your first reaction is usually outdated. Either it's an answer you came up with long ago and now use instead of thinking, or it's a knee-jerk emotional response to something in your past.
	- Say "I don't know" more. 
- Aim to make liberal use of the _you_ pronoun.
- No matter how correct you are, you won't get anywhere by making the other person feel stupid. Not being annoying is more important than being smart. Aim to make friends. [Friends are better than money. Almost anything money can do, friends can do better. In so many ways a friend with a boat is better than owning a boat](https://kk.org/thetechnium/68-bits-of-unsolicited-advice/).
- Ask for help instead of demanding it.
- Favor interrogative-led questions over leading questions. A leading question attempts to get the [[Listening | listener]] to agree or disagree with a premise you feed to them. An interrogative-led question often begins with the words: who; where; what; when; why. "Did you like the movie?" vs "What did you think about the movie?".
- Make [interesting questions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K_iFxFt9lh1i0mxKRIhOSd2e8X1LNvxnihbChKXhyOc/mobilebasic) to know people better. Use FORD (Family, Occupation, Recreation, Dreams) as fallback topics.
- Remember people's names. Humans want to be significant. We strive for meaning.
- Dishonest Flattery while effective in some cases, will destroy you long term. If you are unable to find a compliment about another human being that is truthful, you're not trying hard enough.
- In difficult conversations, keep in mind the ultimate purpose and [[Mindfulness | be calm]]. You don't need to win the conversation. Ensure safety. Control your emotions.
- Share your facts as stories, not global facts.
