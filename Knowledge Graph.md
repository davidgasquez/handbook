# Knowledge Graph

- A knowledge graph is a structured representation of information that connects data points through relationships, forming a semantic network.
  - It is used to represent knowledge where entities are nodes and relationships are edges.
  - It is designed to capture the meaning and context of data, enabling machines to understand and reason about information.
- Knowledge graphs facilitate efficient data discovery and exploration. They provide a common language for expressing and sharing knowledge, fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing among different stakeholders.
