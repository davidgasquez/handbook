1. I wish I'd had the courage to [[Mindfulness|live a life true to myself]], not the life others expected of me.
2. I wish I didn't work so hard.
3. I wish I'd had the courage to [[Openness|express my feelings]].
4. I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.
5. I wish that I had let myself be happier.
