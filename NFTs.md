# NFTs

Unique assets whose value is independent from one another. For example, an NFT might represent a piece of unique digital artwork.

- Today, if you create something digital, ownership is tied in with distribution. If someone makes an `mp3` or a `jpeg` piece of art and post it or sell it online you'll have to have it to consume it (DRM can sometime change this).
- With NFTs, the digital asset you create has a clear, provable owner (you!) and anyone you sell it to (and anyone thereafter) can trace it back to you, the creator, and know it is authentic.
- When you create this NFT thing, you can create rules around it via a smart contract. One of these rules could be that anytime this piece of art you made is transferred across owners, you get 5% of what the new person paid for it, in perpetuity, automatically.
