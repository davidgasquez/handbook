# Values

**Values** or **principles** are what you stand for in life — they are often things that you are for or against — what you believe in and are willing to support and stand up for. Values make you even if you don't know what are yours.

You are what you do (eat, listen, read, watch). Not what you say, not what you believe, not how you vote, but what you spend your time on.

These are the values I try to stand for. **[[Curiosity|Curious]], [[Mindfulness|Mindful]] and [[Openness|Open]]**.
