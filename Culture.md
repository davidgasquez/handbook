# Culture

[Culture](https://github.com/bjeanes/culture/blob/master/culture_and_ethos.md) is simply a shared way of doing something with passion. Culture is created and re-created by the choices made by individuals every day. It can be reshaped by conscious effort applied gently, subtly, and consistently. It is also a shared mechanism for [[Problem Solving]].

- It is _very_ difficult to undo bad culture â€” far more than it is to shape good culture. So it's best to avoid it altogether. You have to constantly be on the lookout for nascent bad behavior, in order to nip it in the bud before it becomes too bad.
- A bad thing to do to the culture is introduce too much tension:
  - There are better battles to fight than with each other.
  - It's hard to say objectively that one culture is "better" than another, but having the culture pulled in multiple directions clearly burns people out, so focus on cultural alignment in decisions and hiring.
- Times change, trends change, cultures change.
- Foster a culture of [people who care](https://grantslatton.com/nobody-cares).
