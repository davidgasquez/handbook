![[Quotes#^620ab0]]

When things interact, they often birth new, unpredictable forms. **The sum total of a system is more than its competent parts**. E.g: biological [[evolution]], Conway's Game of Life, Wikipedia, Minecraft.

You can't top-down plan emergent [[systems]], but you can provoke them into being. [Here are some attributes that emergent systems often have](http://gordonbrander.com/pattern/provoking-emergence/):

- [[Evolution]]
- More than one goal that can be achieved in more than one way.
- Alphabet: An alphabet is a kit of parts, together with rules for combining them (e.g Lego). The simpler the building blocks, the better.
  - A holon is something that is simultaneously a whole in and of itself, as well as a part of a larger whole (e.g: humans).
- An easy initial learning curve but infinite potential (e.g. Minecraft).
- Involves multiple agents. It has [[network effects]].
