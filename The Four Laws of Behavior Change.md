# The Four Laws of Behavior Change

- Any [[Habits|habit]] can be broken down into a [[Feedback Loops|feedback loop]] that involves four steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.
- The ultimate purpose of [[Habits]] is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible. Once our [[Habits]] become automatic, we stop paying attention to what we are doing.

## Building Habits

1. Make it obvious.
   - Identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top.
   - Every habit is initiated by a cue. We are more likely to notice cues that stand out.
   - Make the cues of good habits obvious in your environment.
   - Eliminate a bad habit reducing exposure to the cues that causes it.
2. Make it attractive.
   - Temptation bundling: Take a behavior that you think of as important but unappealing and link it to a behavior that you're drawn to.
   - Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. When dopamine rises, so does our motivation to act.
   - The [[Culture]] we live in determines which behaviors are attractive to us. We tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: the close (family and friends), the many (the tribe), and the powerful (those with status and prestige).
3. Make it easy.
   - Human behavior follows the Law of Least Effort. We will naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work.
   - Create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible.
   - Prime your environment to make future good habits easier and to increase friction for bad habits.
4. Make it satisfying.
   - Attach some immediate gratification to your habits that reinforce your desired [[Identity]].
   - The human brain evolved to [[Time|prioritize]] immediate rewards over delayed rewards.
