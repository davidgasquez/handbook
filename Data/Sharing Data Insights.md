# Sharing Data Insights

  [Sharing your data insights across your organization facilitates collaboration and mutual learning ‚Äì increasing data literacy across the company](https://locallyoptimistic.com/post/share-your-data-insights-to-engage-your-colleagues/). It also helps remind folks that members of the data team can be strategic partners, creating opportunities for proactive brainstorming that can drive innovation.

 The aim is to answer the following questions each time:

 1. **What am I looking at?** A **short-but-informative title** can tell people immediately what data is the focus of the insight.
 2. **What should I learn from this?** or, Why should I care? Include the **most useful information,** and/or a **clear takeaway**. For folks who only have a few seconds to scan the message, it should be **easy to spot** the **most valuable** bit of the insight, the **reason** this exploration was considered worth sharing.
 3. **What caught my eye?** Share a chart or a related resource!
 4. **What if I want to know more?** A **link to additional information** can be valuable for people who have time for more than a quick scan and want to understand how you developed the insight, or do some of their own related exploration.
 5. **What if I have a question?** Explicitly **inviting questions** and responses is crucial. It‚Äôs the best part of sharing an insight! This is where you get to learn about things your colleagues know that you don‚Äôt, or what they‚Äôre curious about but has not yet risen to the level of becoming a data request from them.
 6. **What if posting this prompts a whole bunch of follow-up questions, or exposes incorrect assumptions?** If you have hit on something that‚Äôs interesting to a lot of people there likely will be questions that spin off, new ways to slice the data you‚Äôre looking at, or assumptions you have made that need to be corrected.
