# Data Request Template

Inspired by [Caitlin Hudon Intake Form for Data Requests](https://caitlinhudon.com/2020/09/16/data-intake-form/).

## Why?

- Quick way of gathering context needed for good analysis.
- People need to prepare and that means better kickoff conversation.
- Easier to triage and connect dots across requests.
- Creates easily referenced records of requests.
- Friction cuts down on lazy asks. Too much friction will disuade legit ask.
