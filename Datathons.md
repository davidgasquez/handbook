# Datathons

## Checklist

1. Learn more about the problem. Search for similar Kaggle competitions. Check the task in [Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/).
2. Do a basic data exploration. Try to understand the problem and gather a sense of what can be important.
3. Get baseline model working.
4. Create `scikit-learn` compatible metric if needed.
5. Try different approaches for preprocessing (encodings, Deep Feature Synthesis, lags, aggregations, imputers, ...). If you're working as a group, split preprocessing feature generation between files.
6. Plot learning curves ([sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/learning_curve.html) or [external tools](https://github.com/reiinakano/scikit-plot)) to avoid overfitting.
7. Tune hyper-parameters once you've settled on an specific approach. ([optuna](https://optuna.readthedocs.io/)).
8. Plot and visualize the predictions (histograms, random prediction, ...) to make sure they're doing as expected. Explain the predictions with [SHAP](https://github.com/slundberg/shap).
9. Think about what postprocessing heuristics can be done to improve or correct predictions.
10. [Stack](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/ensemble/plot_stack_predictors.html) classifiers ([example](https://www.kaggle.com/couyang/featuretools-sklearn-pipeline#ML-Pipeline)).
11. Try AutoML models. For tabular data: [TPOT](https://github.com/EpistasisLab/tpot), [AutoSklearn](https://github.com/automl/auto-sklearn), [AutoGluon](https://auto.gluon.ai/stable/index.html), Google AI Platform, [PyCaret](https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret), [Fast.ai](https://docs.fast.ai/), [Alex](https://github.com/Alex-Lekov/AutoML_Alex).For time series: [AtsPy](https://github.com/firmai/atspy), [DeepAR](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/aws-forecast-recipe-deeparplus.html).
