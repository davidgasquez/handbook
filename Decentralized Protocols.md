# Decentralized Protocols
- Decentralized protocols become [fat protocols](https://www.usv.com/writing/2016/08/fat-protocols/).
  - On the internet, the main protocols take care of communications (HTTPS, SSH, ...) and apps are built on top. These apps and services store our data in silos. These protocols are necessary but not valuable. Value is captured by the apps.
  - Fat protocols will use tools like blockchain to store the data. With open protocols and decentralized data ([[Web3]]), apps are only the frontend of the services.
- [Protocol and Open Source Funding](https://youtu.be/few99D5WnRg?list=WL). It'll add to the current ways to to fund open source projects:
  - Consulting: open source the code, sell consulting.
  - Cloud: open source some code, but sell a closed source cloud complement.
  - [Community](https://mobile.twitter.com/balajis/status/1310101055816921090): open source all code, and issue a token or charge for access to the community.
    - Open Source projects would have a protocol. You could buy shares of Kubernetes, Tensorflow, ... or contribute to gain tokens. This [[incentives]] contributing and helping people.

- [Moving to protocols, not platforms](https://knightcolumbia.org/content/protocols-not-platforms-a-technological-approach-to-free-speech), is an approach for free speech in the twenty-first century. Rather than relying on a "marketplace of [[ideas]]" within an individual platform — which can be hijacked by those with malicious intent—protocols could lead to a marketplace of ideals, where competition occurs to provide better services that minimize the impact of those with malicious intent, without cutting off their ability to speak entirely.
	- The fundamental power of the internet is its _interoperability_. It was born out of the ability of different networks to talk to each other using common protocols. The interoperability is what we've lost in the Web 2.0 era. Even such quintessential thing as a web API has no well defined standard or protocol, just a very vague concept of REST or RPC. We need commonly accepted standards and _decentralized_ protocols: for web APIs, for identity management, for message queuing, for web callbacks (webhooks), for online transactions, for semantic web and ontology, etc.
