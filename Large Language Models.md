# Large Language Models

- LLM can build internal [[Knowledge Graphs]]s in their the network layers.
- ML system where humans are designing how the information is organized (feature engineering, linking, graph building) will scale poorly ([the bitter lesson](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html)).

## Tools

- [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/)
- [Llama Index](https://github.com/jerryjliu/llama_index)
- [Llama Hub](https://llamahub.ai/)
- [Shell GPT](https://github.com/TheR1D/shell_gpt)
- [Scapeghost](https://jamesturk.github.io/scrapeghost/)
- [Kor](https://eyurtsev.github.io/kor/index.html)

## Cool Uses of GPT Models

- Naming things.
- A nice thesaurus.
- Brainstorm ([ask many things and then add constraints](https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1633941391121215490)).
- What's the name of the "thing" that does "something"?
- I want to accomplish X. I think I will try doing Y. Is there a better way?

- Generate YAMLs or other DSLs (translate between them).
- Improve existing code (typing, tests, making it async, ...).
- Write basic CLIs.
- [Generate structured data from text](https://thecaglereport.com/2023/03/16/nine-chatgpt-tricks-for-knowledge-graph-workers/).
- Do API request to SQL Semantic Layers (less prone for errors or hallucinating metric definitions)
