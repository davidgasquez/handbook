# DNA Genetic Testing and Analysis

- Companies like 23andMe look only at a few specific genomics coordinates that are known to contain pathogenic variants, but chances are if you have the associated disease you don't have a variant at one of those few select locations. Because of this, [a negative test result does not mean someone isn't at risk for the condition](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/02/01/opinion/23andme-cancer-dna-test-brca.html).
- If it says you don't have something, then that means nothing. If it says you do have something, then that means you should be on the lookout for other corroborating data or symptoms.
- Genetic data may help people today, but it can also be sold to insurance companies in the [[Future]].
- [Your DNA is already probably on a database](https://youtu.be/KT18KJouHWg).
- How valuable it would be giving your DNA to a competent advertising company? They could be able to profile and predict users with significantly higher personal accuracy. On the other hand, this is analogous to the 1800s when people disagreed over whether one should let a camera take your photo. If sequencing prices and mobility continue to advance at current rates, in 30 years your DNA could be sequenced thousands of times a day, everywhere you go in public (the same way you're recorded with security cameras).
