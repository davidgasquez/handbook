# Identity

- [Maintain a very small identity](http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html). The act of labeling yourself is the act of restricting yourself to what you think fits that label. Don't have opinions on everything. Avoid forming an opinion at all about things that are not evident. Do not affiliate your identity with anything extrinsic - such as a religion, political party, country, company, profession, [[Programming]] language, social class, etc.
  - Identity can be helpful in some cases. When we identify as something aligned with our [[Values]] and that can self correct (e.g: rationalism), it encourages you to behave better!
    - [Try to affiliate more strongly with the communities whose core beliefs would be less dangerous if they turned out to be wrong](https://economicsdetective.com/2016/10/identity-mind-killer/).
  - Identity labels are a way of [[Conceptual Compression]]. They help you infer some things about people that identify as something.
- You're not your opinions. Don't define yourself by what you work on or what you hate. Once a belief becomes part of your identity, any evidence that threatens the belief is a personal attack.
- The only constant in the world is that it changes. Identify as someone that changes their mind when the data changes!
