# Plurality

- [Plurality is a political philosophy and framework](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/08/21/plurality.html) that seeks to create mechanisms for large-scale cooperation while preserving diversity and autonomy.
  - Plurality stands between [[Governance|Technocracy]] and [[Decentralized Autonomous Organizations|Libertarianism]], offering a third way that emphasizes connections between individuals and groups.
  - Plurality recognizes that there is no single model that can explain the world perfectly, and we should use a combination of different models instead.
- Key ideas of [Plurality](https://www.plurality.net/):
  - [[Identity]] should be intersectional and social, using the entire set of a person's actions and interactions to determine trustworthiness.
  - [[Governance]] mechanisms should count uncorrelated signals additively but correlated signals with diminishing returns.
  - [[Organizations|Organizations]] should allow different degrees of membership, not just true-or-false.
  - Local currencies and property rights can coexist with global mechanisms for cooperation.
- Plurality technologies include:
  - [Polis](https://pol.is/home) for large-scale conversations that identify consensus across different viewpoints.
  - [Community Notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Notes) that surface content rated highly by people who disagree on other topics.
  - Message Checker and other user-facing tools that protect users while preserving autonomy.
  - Quadratic funding and other mechanisms that subsidize collaboration between different groups.
- Plurality is compatible with:
  - Exponential technological growth, by designing property rights that force rising tides to lift all boats.
  - Valuing excellence and expertise, through mechanisms like prediction markets with per-person subsidies.
  - Local experimentation in social media, blockchain ecosystems, and local government.
