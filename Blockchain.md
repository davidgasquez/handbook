# Blockchain
- [A blockchain is a decentralized database](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4).
- Blockchain solve the Byzantine Generals Problem: [How do participants in a decentralized network communicate and coordinate with each other towards some action without relying on a trusted third-party?](https://a16z.com/2019/11/08/crypto-glossary/).
	- Blockchains are "trustless". There are mechanisms in place by which all parties in the [[Systems | system]] can reach a consensus on what the canonical truth is.
	- Power and trust is distributed (or shared) among the network's stakeholders (e.g. developers, miners, and consumers), rather than concentrated in a single individual or entity (e.g. banks, governments, and financial institutions).
	- Blockchains put the code in charge.
	- Blockchains allow permisionless innovation.
- Blockchains is useful when these conditions are met:
	- The resource is scarce (limited).
	- Fungible (there isn't a difference between two items. eg. storing files). All the coins are mutually interchangeable.
	- The resource can be provided by a lot of people.
- Smart contracts can be defined as code that's replicated and executed on all the blockchain nodes.
- Smart contracts allow permissionless composability. [Composability allows anyone in a network to take existing programs and adapt or build on top of them, it unlocks completely new use cases that don’t exist in our world](https://future.a16z.com/how-composability-unlocks-crypto-and-everything-else/).
- [Blockchains could replace networks with markets](https://twitter.com/naval/status/877467629308395521).
- One of the main downsides of blockchains is that most humans are not good at protecting their passwords, credentials or private keys.
