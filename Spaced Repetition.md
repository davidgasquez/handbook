# Spaced Repetition

- Make cards that are [atomic, connected and meaningful](https://ncase.me/remember/).
- Use one big deck.
- [What makes Spaced Repetition better than conventional flashcards is that it manages the review schedule. If you can answer a question correctly, the time interval between reviews gradually expands](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html).
- Make cards following the [20 rules of formulating knowledge](https://www.supermemo.com/en/archives1990-2015/articles/20rules).
- If memorizing something will likely save you five minutes in the future, add it to your preferred Spaded Repetition Software.
