# Governance

Governance is a tool an [[Organizations | organization]] uses to decide where power should reside and who gets to click on what button. This process places rails around operations, which helps an organization get from point A to point B more smoothly.

- There is an idea that governance—public or corporate—[is driven by the self-interested effort of leaders to acquire and keep their power](https://fs.blog/the-dictators-handbook/).
- [Governance means conflict](https://twitter.com/armaniferrante/status/1450878886535839745). It also means resolution. Accept the former, focus on the latter, via transparency.
