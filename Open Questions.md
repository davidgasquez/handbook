# Open Questions

Some questions which I'm intrigued about and haven't researched enough to add their own entry on this handbook.

Inspired by [Gwern Questions](https://www.gwern.net/Questions), [Patrick Collison](https://patrickcollison.com/questions) and [Alexey Guzey](https://guzey.com/personal/research-ideas/).

- [What is a good approach to effective education?](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mMKKsbxGiNirGjsA9/effective-children-education).
  - Would it be better if we grouped kids by skill level instead of age?
  - [What's the best way of teaching kids how to think?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24638756)
  - [How can schools be optimized?](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/book-review-the-cult-of-smart)
  - How does effective [[Parenting]] looks like?
- [Are nootropics useful?](https://www.gwern.net/Nootropics)
- How can [Genetic Engineering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAhjPd4uNFY) do good and [how can it go badly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n__42UNIhvU).
  - What happens when we start [[DNA Genetic Testing and Analysis|tinkering with our genes after improving our health]]?
- What would improve current public discussion platforms?
- [[Open Data|How can we improve the Open Data Ecosystem]]?
  - Can Impact DAOs be formed around collecting and using data for good?
- I feel most people recycle by inertia. We feel good doing something we've been told helps the planet. The reality might be the opposite since there is no data and transparency around that. What other topics are in the same state?
