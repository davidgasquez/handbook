# Double Crux

[Double crux](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/exa5kmvopeRyfJgCy/double-crux-a-strategy-for-resolving-disagreement) is great framework were both parties abstract their arguments by one level and find a falsifiable fact that, if proven true, would cause them to change their beliefs.

- Focus on narrowing the scope of the [[Resolving Disagreement |discussion]]. Find common ground.
- Define terms to avoid getting lost in semantic confusions that miss the real point.
- Ask "What would need to be true for you to change your mind?".
- Find specific test cases.

**Don't focus on proving yourself right, instead of focus on getting the best outcome.** Keep the conversation simple and summarize the conversation during the discussion.
