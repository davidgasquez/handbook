# Routine

A way to keep yourself on track with your [[habits]] is to have a routine.

1. **Rules**. Remind yourself on the current set of rules, constrains, various addictions, time-draining things. E.g. limit social media, do some stretching, ...
2. **Gratitude**. Visualize and [[Meditation|meditate]] on the idea that you might die today.
3. **Long-term goals and short-term [[goals]]**. Review big goals that you would like to achieve in the next years and the short term goals that lead to them that you can act on.
4. **Visualize the day**. Visualize yourself going through the day challenges and wins.

## Small Actions

Small lifestyle changes that can lead to large impact:

- Start every day as a producer, not a consumer.
- Stretch each time you stand up.
- Go for small walks after lunch.
- No screens on the bedroom.
- Read one page a day.
- Be specific (time, words, actions).

- Consume content mindfully.
- Do experiments with life (A/B tests).
- Automate one thing.
- Chat with everyone.
- Actively reach out to friends and family.
- Take notes on everything you learn and share them.
