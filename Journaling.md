# Journaling

- Journaling is a "keystone" habit. It tightly locks all of your other [[habits]] in place.
- It helps build a self evaluation loop in your life. It gives you the ability to discover what were you thinking and how the decisions turned out. If you don't reflect on your past, any improvements you do in the future will be by randomness.
- When you are in an intensely emotional mood, journaling can help you more fully experience and understand those emotions.
- [Journal about things, people, or situations for which you are grateful](https://youtu.be/fSwpe8r50_o). Consider including negative situations like avoiding an accident, for instance. **Be specific!**
- The development of a coherent narrative helps you reorganize and structure old memories, making them less traumatic.
- [[Writing]] on a regular basis may allow for repeated exposure to your old memories, which will help you get rid of your negative emotional responses.
- **Premeditatio Malorum**. By imagining the worst case scenario ahead of time, you could overcome the fear of negative experiences and make better plans to prevent them.

- There are many methods. Start with a simple one like "What worked, what didn't, what's next".
- Weekly Review:
  - [Review what happened during the week](https://www.benkuhn.net/weekly/). How did the week go? Write down a list of topics to think about and take written notes on each topic as you think about them.
  - Review a set of recurrent prompts. Tweak them over time. For example:
  - Consistency at your core [[habits]] this week ([[Fitness]], [[Routine]], [[Productivity]], etc.). How can you tweak them to be more consistent or more useful?
  - What did you do this week that was a mistake and how can I avoid repeating it?
	- What would you like to accomplish next week?
	  - Do you need to clarify something?
	  - Which actions will you move closer to your [[goals]]?
