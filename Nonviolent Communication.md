# Nonviolent Communication

[Nonviolent communication (NVC)](https://www.clearerthinking.org/post/2019/03/06/want-to-improve-your-relationships-try-nonviolent-communication-1) is a popular method of conflict resolution that privileges unbiased evidence and specificity. It is also a tool for thinking that may help improve the way you communicate, whether it be with family, friends, colleagues.

## The Four Steps

1. **Observe Facts** - observe the specific facts that are affecting our wellbeing, and bring them up with the other person.
2. **Note Feelings** - introspect about what exactly we are feeling in response to what we've observed, and communicate these feelings.
3. **Uncover Desires** - figure out the desires, wants and [[Values]] that are creating our feelings, and explain them to the other person.
4. **Make Requests** - ask for concrete actions to help resolve the situation.
