# Asynchronous Communications

- Having [asynchronous communication channels and making heavy use of them can have great effects on productivity](https://www.martinklepsch.org/posts/asynchronous-communication.html).
- Every question asked in an internal Slack is a policy failure.
- [Asynchronous environments allows for self discovery without interruptions](https://snir.dev/blog/remote-async-communication/):
	- You can keep on your flow without waiting for someone to give you details.
	- You can get into "Deep [[Focus]]" session without context switching that allows for better [[productivity]].
	- You can work whenever, since you are not dependent on anyone immediately.
	- You'll have written records of everything.
- [Async communication](https://protocol.almanac.io/docs/async-work-ezPny9x7Q50QISL4UIUhB3PoURV0lgxP) takes more time but it enable better thinking. Learn to [[Asking Questions |ask better questions]] and [[Writing |write requests]].
- The 4 components of a [great asynchronous message](https://protocol-labs.gitbook.io/launchpad-curriculum/launchpad-learning-resources/protocol-labs-network/os-stewardship#sync-comms):
	1. Enough information to cover all follow-up questions.
	2. A deadline. When do you need a response by? How urgent is it? Which task is being blocked right now?
	3. Links, images, and as much supporting material as possible that will help illustrate your thoughts.
	4. A concrete need. What do you want to get out of the communication? Approval on a task? An asset of some kind? Be clear.
- Beware of the (cultural) Power Distance Index. The lower the PDI, the more direct communications are preferred; the higher, the more diplomatic the communications are preferred.
